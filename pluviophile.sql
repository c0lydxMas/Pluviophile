His toy boat floats into a cavern, leading him to the scientist responsible for the creation of Shimmer&mdash;the same one we saw during Act 1. He\'s accompanied by a massive, pink lizard. A rare mutation that he cultivated, he explains, but the lizard is dying and he\'s trying to prevent that. Viktor asks if he can help and the two join forces. Flashing forward in time, Heimerdinger finds Viktor brooding over his diagnosis. The two commiserate over Viktor\'s looming death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viktor\'s health is also on Jayce\'s mind. He arrives at councillor Mel Medarda\'s apartment to inform her of Viktor\'s diagnosis. His sickness likely stems from the noxious gases he was exposed to in the Undercity as a boy, Jayce says. The exact kind of danger that Hextech could save people from. Meanwhile, at the lab, a dying Viktor finally has his breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Arcane&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cau4hSK8yPt5xvWQ8S4LQ8-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cau4hSK8yPt5xvWQ8S4LQ8-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cau4hSK8yPt5xvWQ8S4LQ8-970-80.jpg 970w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: Riot Games/Netflix)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Desperate times, desperate measures&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At The Last Drop, Jinx discovers from one of Silco\'s goons that there\'s a manhunt for two women (obviously Vi and Caitlyn&mdash;but Jinx doesn\'t know that). She\'s curious, so she decides to investigate. Just then, Caitlyn and a severely-injured Vi take refuge in an abandoned building deep in the Undercity. As several of Silco\'s men run by, one of the Firelights from Episode 4 watches from the shadows. Sometime later, Sevika returns to Silco\'s office to inform him that they lost track of Vi and Caitlyn but instead find\'s Jinx waiting for her. Jinx interrogates Sevika and learns that Vi is still alive and looking for her. Seems like a reunion is in order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcus returns home after a long day of being a corrupt bag of shit and finds Silco and his thugs playing with his daughter. Silco has a bone to pick. Turns out, Marcus lied and said he murdered Vi when he captured her following Vander\'s death in episode 3. But now that Vi and Caitlyn are causing a ruckus in the Undercity, Silco knows the truth. Marcus begs for an opportunity to fix his mistake and Silco obliges, but the consequences are clear: Fail, and he\'ll hurt Marcus\'s daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in Piltover, Viktor\'s breakthrough is incredible. The Hextech crystal responds to organic matter, like his blood, and can create life. Already Viktor is able to use the crystal to manifest wild and strange plants, but he believes it could be used to extend life and even cure diseases. Diseases just like the one killing him now. There\'s just one problem: It\'s &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; not stable. Before long, the plants the Hextech crystal creates all die. Viktor\'s time is short though, so Jayce commits to doing whatever it takes to solve this last riddle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Arcane&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EdBrGKhKBZFqdXs4WHzp28-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EdBrGKhKBZFqdXs4WHzp28-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EdBrGKhKBZFqdXs4WHzp28-970-80.jpg 970w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: Riot Games/Netflix)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Desperate for help, the two call on Heimerdinger. But after explaining this new development in Hextech, Heimerdinger is more resolute than ever that Hextech must be destroyed because it\'s simply too dangerous. Jayce refuses and, despite Heimerdinger\'s pleas, says it\'s a matter the Council will decide on. Viktor then explains he might know someone else who can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vi and Caitlyn, still on the run, discover a massive ghetto hidden in one of the caverns deep underground. The people there are all addicted to Shimmer, the narcotic Silco manufactures. One of the addicts recognizes Vi and wants to help, so he leads Caitlyn to a healer who creates a potion that can heal Vi\'s wounds. In exchange for a healing potion, Caitlyn trades her rifle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe not the smartest trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in Piltover, Marcus presents Jayce with Jinx\'s grenade as evidence that the Firelights were responsible for the bombing on Progress Day. Wanting to secure Piltover from any further terrorist attacks, Jayce orders Marcus to lock down the bridge between Piltover and Zaun and search anyone coming across.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hours later, the Council convenes to discuss Viktor\'s breakthrough in organic Hextech. Heimerdinger\'s plea is dwarfed by Jayce\'s concerns that the city is too vulnerable to attack. With Shimmer running rampant in the Undercity and Firelights (supposedly) bombing Piltover, Jayce makes the argument that Heimerdinger is no longer capable of maintaining order over the city. He moves to remove Heimerdinger from the Council and the other councillors agree. It\'s a vicious betrayal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the potion, Caitlyn is able to revive Vi and staunch her bleeding. But before the two can figure out the next step, Silco arrives on the scene. The Shimmer addict who helped Caitlyn sold them out for some of Silco\'s shimmer. The two exchange some threats but Silco wants to do more than talk and sics a trio of Shimmer mutants on Vi. With nowhere to run, Vi punches a support beam loose and causes the entire building she and Caitlyn were hiding in to collapse, nearly killing Silco. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Arcane&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4sYg5jQ5Gz53zdfLfRvwr5-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4sYg5jQ5Gz53zdfLfRvwr5-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4sYg5jQ5Gz53zdfLfRvwr5-970-80.jpg 970w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: Riot Games/Netflix)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they flee through the Undercity, Jinx finds a tall building and lights the signal flare Vi gave her years ago&mdash;before Vander died. The flare Jinx was supposed to light if she needed Vi to come and save her. As Vi and Caitlyn flee Silco, Vi spots the smoke from the flare and remembers her promise to Jinx. Just then, we see Marcus and a battalion of Enforcers enact Jayce\'s order to lock down the bridges between Piltover and the Undercity. Meanwhile, Silco arrives back at his headquarters to find Sevika tied up and &quot;liar&quot; spray painted all over her body. Seems like Jinx isn\'t all that pleased that Silco lied about Vi for all these years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flashing back in time, a young Viktor arrives at the scientist\'s lair and sees him draining the blood from his magical giant lizard. Flashing forward, adult Viktor enters that same lair. The lizard is now encased in a giant tank, seemingly being kept alive to produce more Shimmer. &quot;I understand now,&quot; Viktor says as the scientist turns around to reveal his face, now scorched by the explosion that killed Milo, Claggor, and Vander. Surprise! The scientist is obviously Singed, another iconic League champ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That\'s not the only big reunion happening, though. Vi finally finds Jinx after so many years apart and explains that she didn\'t intend to abandon her but was captured by Marcus before she could save Jinx. It\'s a touching moment spoiled by the arrival of Caitlyn, whom Jinx immediately recognizes as an Enforcer. It\'s a double whammy of a revelation, though. As Jinx realizes that Vi is working with Piltover Enforcers, Caitlyn realizes Vi\'s sister is the terrorist responsible for the Progress Day bombing that killed half a dozen Enforcers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stress of the situation sets Jinx on edge and she begins rambling incoherently at the specters of Milo and Claggor that haunt her. Vi tries to calm Jinx but before she can, those pesky Firelights show up on their hoverboards again and attack the whole lot of them. In the chaos, Jinx drops the Hextech crystal she stole and Vi gets a glimpse of just how deranged her sister has become. The Firelights overwhelm the trio and abduct Caitlyn and Vi in addition to also swiping the Hextech crystal, leaving Jinx all alone again.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that\'s the end of Act 2.

We rely on it to provide us with valid conceptions of the nature of the physical world and how it works, conceptions that underpin almost every aspect of our technologically advanced society. At root, physics as a discipline relies on foundational theories of space and time, and of matter and light. For the most part, physicists are content to make use of foundational theories that have remained broadly unchanged for centuries. These are good enough for most practical purposes. But as they explore the physics of the very fast, or of the very small, or as they ponder the large-scale structure of the Universe, they reach for younger theories that were established only a century ago. These are quantum mechanics and Albert Einstein&rsquo;s theories of relativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mechanics is that part of physics concerned with stuff that moves, and quantum mechanics is the theory of the motion of matter and light at the smallest scales: the realm of molecules, atoms, subatomic particles (such as electrons), and photons, the quanta (or &lsquo;atoms&rsquo;) of light. If you want to figure out how an electron will behave as it moves in time through space, then you need to reach for quantum mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there&rsquo;s a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quantum mechanics was discovered and developed largely by European physicists in the mid- to late 1920s. As they struggled to comprehend what nature was trying to tell them, these pioneers understood only too well what they were getting themselves into. Although there had been much discussion about the philosophical interpretation of some concepts that appear in the older theory that preceded it &ndash; now called classical mechanics &ndash; the nature and structure of the new quantum mechanics begged all kinds of difficult questions about the very purpose of a scientific theory, if not the purpose of science itself. The debate became polarised around the philosophies of its two principal protagonists: Einstein and the Danish physicist Niels Bohr. The small community of quantum physicists in continental Europe formed into two distinct camps, and the Austrian-born British philosopher Karl Popper later called this divergence a schism. At the heart of the debate was the interpretation of the theory&rsquo;s central concept &ndash; a mathematical object called the wave function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wave function was introduced in the theory as a way of accounting for the surprising experimental behaviour exhibited by quantum entities such as electrons. Under certain circumstances, this behaviour can be described in terms of electrons as familiar self-contained particles, localised as they move through space. But in different (and mutually exclusive) circumstances, the behaviour can be understood only in terms of electrons moving and spreading out through space as unfamiliar, non-localised waves. The wave function accommodates this odd duality. It has obvious wave-like properties, but also obvious particle-like properties, such as mass. It underpins a formula that assigns probabilities for any given electron existing in any one place at a particular point in time. What we might have previously judged to be physically impossible, quantum mechanics judges to be merely improbable, lending a fungible quality to reality, and challenging the truth of a universe defined by the physics that came before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And here&rsquo;s the rub. We never observe the wave function. If we push an electron through a narrow aperture, we imagine that it will diffract, spreading out in all directions in the space beyond as a wave (think of what happens to a rolling ocean wave as it squeezes through a gap in a harbour wall). If we now allow this electron to impinge on a screen covered with a photographic emulsion, we will find that the electron is detected, leaving a single bright spot at a specific point on the screen. Repeating this with more and more electrons will give us a diffraction pattern &ndash; a pattern possible only with waves &ndash; made up of a myriad of individual spots, each of which is possible only with particles. Where will the next spot appear? We have no way of knowing in advance. All we can do is use the wave function to calculate the probability that the next electron will be detected here, or there, or way over there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are we supposed to make of this? If we interpret the wave function realistically, as a tangible physical thing, we then have to figure out how it &lsquo;collapses&rsquo; to produce a spot at only one location out of all the other probable locations on the screen. Such a collapse implies what Einstein in 1927 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1876050308703323&quot;&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; &lsquo;an entirely peculiar mechanism of action at a distance&rsquo; &ndash; an anathema of ghostly physical effects transmitted instantaneously across space with no apparent direct cause, now generally referred to as the &lsquo;measurement problem&rsquo;. For Einstein, the lack of any kind of physical explanation for how this is supposed to happen meant that something is missing; that quantum mechanics is in some way incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bohr disagreed. He &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1876050308703815&quot;&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that in quantum mechanics we have hit a fundamental limit. What we observe is quantum behaviour as projected into our classical world of direct experience. As we cannot transcend this experience, we have to accept that the wave function has no physical significance beyond its relevance to the calculation of probabilities. We must be content with a &lsquo;purely symbolic&rsquo; mathematical formalism that works. The wave function doesn&rsquo;t collapse (and there&rsquo;s no peculiar action at a distance) because it doesn&rsquo;t actually exist, and so there is no measurement problem. In other words, all we can know is the electron-as-it-appears in different experimental arrangements. We can never know what the electron really is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an empiricist, &lsquo;antirealist&rsquo;, or (to some) an &lsquo;instrumentalist&rsquo; interpretation, which judges a theory to be largely meaningless except as an instrument to connect together our empirical experiences. Such an antirealist theory doesn&rsquo;t necessarily deny the existence of an objective reality (we can happily continue to assume that the Moon is still there even if nobody looks at it or thinks about it), nor does it necessarily deny the reality of unobserved electrons, however we imagine them. But it does deny a direct and exact correspondence between the wave function and the things that the wave function purportedly describes. The formalism appears simply to encode our experiences of quantum phenomena in ways that allow us to calculate the probability that this or that will happen next. Quantum mechanics is complete, and we just need to get over it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physics is important.

With Vander captured by Silco and his thugs, Vi, Milo, and Claggor staged a daring rescue operation that went horribly wrong and ended with the four trapped inside of a meat locker without much hope for escape. Powder, wanting to &lt;i&gt;finally &lt;/i&gt;be of some use to her friends, snuck into Silco\'s lair and armed a magically-enhanced grenade she hoped would save the day. Instead it just killed all of her friends, seriously wounded her sister, and put Vander in a position where he had no choice but to sacrifice himself to save Vi. The two sisters, now orphans a second time, are then separated, with Powder joining Silco\'s ranks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a grim ending to Arcane\'s first act, but we\'re not given much time to dwell on it because episode 4 kicks off with a big time skip. Years have passed since Vander\'s death, and now Vi, Powder, and the rest of the gang (those still alive, at least), are much older and much closer to becoming the champions we recognize from League of Legends. Just as importantly, Jayce\'s Hextech has transformed Piltover into a global wonder. Hexgates now magically connected the city to others all over the world, making it the center of the known universe. Because of his enormous contributions, Heimerdinger wants Jayce to deliver the keynote presentation at Piltover\'s big festival of science: Progress Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Arcane&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yX8zpyFbbm24eAiPup4vS4-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yX8zpyFbbm24eAiPup4vS4-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yX8zpyFbbm24eAiPup4vS4-970-80.jpg 970w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: Riot Games/Netflix)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The pursuit of progress&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jayce has come a long way from being a science pariah. He\'s now the face of Piltover and back in the good graces of his patrons, the Kirammans. Meanwhile, Kiramman\'s sole daughter, Caitlyn, is now a Piltover Enforcer&mdash;much to her parent\'s shame&mdash;and she\'s about to get her first big case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Piltover\'s shipping docks, Silco\'s lieutenant, Sevika, is running a smuggling operation to transport the mysterious pink liquid that mutates people into monsters (it\'s called Shimmer, by the way). Just as a new shipment is about to head out, the airship is attacked by a rival gang of hoverboarding badasses called the Firelights. The Firelights try to destroy the Shimmer, but are attacked by a grownup Powder. She\'s no longer a sniveling runt, but a psycho with a gatling gun and a love of explosions. During the chaos, she unmasks one of the Firelights and mistakes them for Vi, and her reaction betrays the fact that Powder is still very traumatized by what happened all those years ago. Jinx loses control of her emotions and shoots the airship to bits, destroying the smuggled Shimmer, as the remaining Firelights escape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Jayce\'s lab, he and Viktor show Heimerdinger their newest breakthrough on Hextech: Perfectly stabilized and safe Hextech crystals that can be used to power anything from mining lasers to construction equipment. Jayce wants to unveil it during his Progress Day keynote, but Heimerdinger warns against it, saying the technology is still too unsafe for everyday use. Jayce and Viktor are, again, frustrated and demoralized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the burnt remains of the airship Silco was smuggling on, Caitlyn does some sniffing around and turns up some interesting clues, including one that\'s still breathing. He was one of Silco\'s thugs that got shot by Jinx during her little tantrum, but before she can get answers, Marcus shows up. He\'s been promoted to Sheriff of Piltover now that Grayson is dead, and has the injured man sent to prison without any further questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Undercity, Sevika returns to The Last Drop, Vander\'s old bar that\'s been transformed into Silco\'s headquarters. She tries to convince Silco that Jinx is too unpredictable and should be cut loose, but Silco refuses to listen. After Sevika leaves, Jinx drops down from the rafters she was hiding in. She tells Silco what happened and he consoles her like a father, telling her that Vi is dead and she needs to move on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Arcane&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nQ47JegMSNxFp7mRcBPHD3-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nQ47JegMSNxFp7mRcBPHD3-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nQ47JegMSNxFp7mRcBPHD3-970-80.jpg 970w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: Riot Games/Netflix)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jinx obviously isn\'t okay, though. In her hideout, a broken industrial fan dangling over an enormous crevasse, she debates with herself about Vi\'s fate and is haunted by apparitions of Milo and Claggor. She\'s even created puppets of Milo and Claggor that she talks to. Fearing that Silco thinks she\'s weak, Jinx resolves to show him just how capable she is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a Progress Day party in Piltover, Jayce seeks advice from councillor Mel Medarda. She urges him not to listen to Heimerdinger. But during the speech a few hours later, Jayce loses his nerve and doesn\'t unveil the next generation of Hextech, disappointing councillor Medarda and Viktor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the presentation, Caitlyn and her fellow enforcers are hanging out when they see a fire burning down the block. They rush to help, but it\'s actually a trap rigged by Jinx to lure the Enforcers into a burning building where a pile of explosives kills them all&mdash;except Caitlyn, who barely survives. Turns out the whole thing was a distraction so that Jinx could sneak into the building they were guarding and steal the stabilized Hextech crystal and Jayce\'s research. Back in Jinx\'s hideout, an enraged Silco confronts her for recklessly endangering his criminal empire. But when Jinx reveals the Hextech crystal she stole, he starts to see things differently.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enraged by the attack, Piltover\'s Council sees it as a sign that the Undercity is growing too unruly and needs to be kept in check. Just as concerning, Jayce reveals the Hextech crystal could be used to create a powerful weapon in the right hands. Faced with so many threats, councillor Medarda proposes that Jayce be elected as a new councillor. Heimerdinger backs the motion, and it passes. Now Jayce is in the big leagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Arcane&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dFbVpxTMiDQ8DA9Q728ETo-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dFbVpxTMiDQ8DA9Q728ETo-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dFbVpxTMiDQ8DA9Q728ETo-970-80.jpg 970w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: Riot Games/Netflix)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He goes to visit Caitlyn, who should be recovering from the attack but is instead in full-on detective mode. Jinx\'s telltale spray paint was all over the crime scene at the docks and the Progress Day bombing, and Caitlyn thinks she can connect it to the rumors of the Undercity\'s new crime lord (who is Silco, obviously). There\'s just one problem: Her folks weren\'t so hot on her putting her life on the line for justice and pulled strings to have Caitlyn fired from the Enforcers. Jayce offers her a ceremonial position, but she refuses out of pride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not willing to give up, Caitlyn chases her only lead: the wounded thug she found on the ruined airship that was taken to Stillwater Prison. When she arrives, though, Caitlyn learns the thug had the shit kicked out of him by another inmate and won\'t be able to talk for weeks. Curious to know why he was attacked, Caitlyn requests to see the inmate that attacked him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you guess who it might be? It\'s Vi!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that\'s a wrap on episode 4 of Arcane.

Their conversation afterward, where Grayson reveals she is an Enforcer, plays a pivotal role in guiding Caitlyn to enlisting. Flashing forward to where we left off last episode, Caitlyn interrogates a now-imprisoned Vi about the clues she found at the scene of Jinx\'s bombing. Vi claims it has something to do with Silco and she can find the proof needed to lock him up if she\'s released. Though initially hesitant, Caitlyn accepts Vi\'s offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the title sequence, we cut to Marcus, now a sheriff, delivering a eulogy at a funeral for the Enforcers that died in Jinx\'s bombing in Piltover during the last episode. After the funeral, Marcus meets Silco in the Undercity and the two argue as Marcus demands Jinx be arrested as she\'s too unpredictable. Silco counters, saying that if the Council needs a scapegoat, Marcus should lay the blame on the Firelights&mdash;that gang that flies around on hoverboards from the previous episode. Since the Firelights are a danger to both Piltover and Silco\'s operation, it only makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Arcane&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9CF6hLyCs7M8wGbVtnqGd7-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9CF6hLyCs7M8wGbVtnqGd7-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9CF6hLyCs7M8wGbVtnqGd7-970-80.jpg 970w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: Riot Games/Netflix)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Deals with the devil&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside the Hexgate, Viktor and Jayce are having their own argument. Jayce is obsessed with rooting out the corruption and smuggling happening in Piltover, while Viktor is upset that Jayce delayed the announcement of Hextech tools that\'ll directly improve the lives of the lower class&mdash;especially in the Undercity. Before anything else can happen, Viktor begins coughing blood and takes his leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jinx, meanwhile, is tinkering with the spoils of her attack in Piltover: the stabilized Hextech crystal. She tries activating it, and the resulting explosion triggers flashbacks to the explosion she caused in episode 3 that killed Milo and Claggor. &quot;It was a mistake,&quot; she cries. We later see Jinx arrive at the abandoned arcade the orphans used to frequent. Finding Vi\'s old boxing machine game, Jinx tries her best to beat his older sister\'s high score but fails, sending her into a fit of rage. Despite how far she\'s come, Jinx still can\'t escape Vi\'s shadow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoping to uncover some concrete evidence, Vi and Caitlyn sneak into the Undercity and beat up some local thugs and steal their clothes to help disguise Caitlyn\'s Enforcer uniform. The two grab some grub from a local fish vendor who gives Vi a napkin with a mysterious symbol written on it. That symbol, Vi knows, leads to the back door of the Undercity\'s biggest brothel, where Vi seeks answers with the yordle who owns it. The two talk about the past and how Silco rose to power in the Undercity practically unchallenged. Vi asks about Powder, but the only clue the yordle can give is the location of Silco\'s lieutenant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viktor and Jayce reconvene at their lab where Viktor begins more work on the Hextech crystal. It\'s his belief that the crystals are far more powerful than Jayce and he initially believed and that the arcane energies inside can learn and adapt to fulfill new purposes. Jayce seems reluctant, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a prestigious concert, councillor Mel Medarda informs Jayce that his meddling with the smuggling operations in Piltover have caused quite a stir among the nobility&mdash;most notably his fellow councillors, most of whom were importing illegal luxuries. &quot;You\'ve just made yourself everyone\'s common enemy, Jayce,&quot; Medarda says. Jayce despises the politics that come with his new role as councillor, but Medarda convinces him to see the value in bending the rules to make alliances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Arcane&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rAPmR548JCSHJY9CRZQSC7-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rAPmR548JCSHJY9CRZQSC7-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rAPmR548JCSHJY9CRZQSC7-970-80.jpg 970w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: Riot Games/Netflix)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jayce spends the evening striking deals with Piltover\'s elite and his fellow councillors. It becomes clear that Medarda might only be using Jayce as a puppet. But also maybe not. Back at her apartment, Jayce and Medarda sleep together. Meanwhile, Viktor is still at the lab, trying to unlock the mysterious Hextech crystal. He has another coughing fit and sprays blood over this workstation before passing out. The crystal reacts to his blood and triggers a new kind of magical reaction. Sometime later, Viktor wakes in a hospital bed with Jayce at his side. He doesn\'t have much longer to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcus returns to Silco\'s headquarters (now in The Last Tap) and spills the beans about Jayce\'s crusade to clean up corruption. It\'s only a matter of time before Marcus\'s dirty deals are uncovered, so Silco gives him one of Jinx\'s bombs he can use as evidence to frame the Firelights. Marcus considers triggering it to become a martyr and kill himself and Silco, but cowardice gets the best of him. As he leaves, Silco muses that Marcus is beginning to lose his nerve and he needs to find a way to weaponize the Hextech crystal Jinx swiped. Jinx, listening from the rafters, admits she\'s too scared to try. Silco takes Jinx to the river where Vander tried to drown him years earlier. He explains that on that day, the old Silco died and was reborn. He encourages Jinx to let Powder die, and baptizes her in the river.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Arcane&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nMgBg5WacJ9zq2G4Kx7dS5-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nMgBg5WacJ9zq2G4Kx7dS5-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nMgBg5WacJ9zq2G4Kx7dS5-970-80.jpg 970w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: Riot Games/Netflix)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vi tracks down Silco\'s lieutenant: It\'s Sevika, the woman who switched sides in Act 1 after thinking Vander had lost his will to fight. The explosion that killed Milo and Claggor also took her arm, which has been replaced by a Shimmer-enhanced robotic one. She and Vi fight savagely, but when Sevika explains that Jinx isn\'t Silco\'s hostage but his adoptive daughter Vi\'s surprise gives her the opening she needs. Sevika stabs Vi, mortally wounding her. Just before she can finish her off, though, Caitlyn arrives on the scene. Sevika flees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just before the credits roll, we\'re shown a flurry of scenes. Jinx, now ready to leave the past behind, works on the Hextech crystal and appears to be close to successfully activating it. Sevika arrives in Silco\'s office and informs him that Vi is back. &quot;From the dead?&quot; Silco exclaims, looking confused and terrified.

Springora charts her two-year relationship with Matzneff, which began in 1986, when she was 14 and he 49, and critiques the cultural landscape that allowed it to happen, the complicity of her mother, and the intellectual and artistic circles that revolved around the Parisian neighbourhood of Saint-Germain-des-Pr&eacute;s where they lived. A year later, there was another astonishing expos&eacute;, &lt;i&gt;La familia grande&lt;/i&gt; (2021) by Camille Kouchner &ndash; the daughter of France&rsquo;s former foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner &ndash; documenting the incestuous relationship between her stepfather, the academic and politician Olivier Duhamel, and Kouchner&rsquo;s twin brother, then aged 14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d2e1bqvws99ptg.cloudfront.net/user_image_upload/1709/consent-8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Springora and Kouchner broke years of silence with these testimonies, laying bare the sexual violations these men committed, and landing a bomb right into the centre of the French elite who had allowed them to escape blame for so long. The bomb site is still smoking. Yet, barely two years ago, Matzneff was given safe refuge in his own country, where the authorities chose to turn a blind eye to his unashamed paedophilia &ndash; clear to anyone with eyes to see, given that he wrote up his exploits in widely published books. He was a recipient of a writer&rsquo;s allowance by the Centre national du livre (National Centre of the Book), and in 1995 the minister of culture awarded him the Order of Arts and Letters in recognition of his contribution to the arts and literature. In 2013, he was awarded the Renaudot, one of France&rsquo;s most prestigious literary awards (his friends were on the panel). But, paradoxically, this award was also the first unravelling, finally driving an outraged Springora out of hiding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Springora was introduced to Matzneff when she was 13, at a family friend&rsquo;s dinner party she attended with her mother. She recalls how he seduced the guests with his charisma, but his eyes were always on her. Her mother flirted for his attention and offered to drive him home; despite knowing his preference for young girls, she allowed her just-teen daughter to sit beside him on the backseat where &lsquo;something magnetic passed between us. He had his arm against mine, his eyes on me, and the predatory smile of a large golden wildcat.&rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What followed was his grooming of Springora through a series of intensely complimentary letters, sometimes writing twice a day. When she finally wrote back to him (she&rsquo;d just turned 14) he &lsquo;pounced&rsquo;. He would wait for her on the street, devising an impromptu encounter, then invited her to his apartment, for pastries, where he kissed her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Springora is honest about her infatuation with Matzneff in the early months of their relationship, about the novel intoxication of being desired so profoundly. In some ways, she is the classic victim, abandoned by a father who had no interest in her, and with a mother who worked long hours. She was bookish, reclusive, different from her peers, but could be independent minded and fierce when her mother attempted to intervene. She was progressive and spirited, radical in her outlook. Matzneff had chosen wisely. This was a young girl who would be intrigued, admiring even, of her predator&rsquo;s distain for the bourgeois family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matzneff assumed the role of mentor, telling himself perhaps that his actions lay within the traditional Hellenic &lt;a href=&quot;https://aeon.co/essays/pederasts-as-monsters-and-the-problem-of-active-not-knowing&quot;&gt;framework&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;i&gt;pederasty&lt;/i&gt;, a romantic relationship between a teacher and student, generally considered to be more emotionally driven than sexual. He showed an interest in Springora&rsquo;s schoolwork, helped her write her essays, let her walk with him through the Luxembourg Gardens, privileging her with his attention, an elegant award-winning literary hero. All the same, he was discreet. He was careful that his predations were seen to be within the law. French law did not legislate an age of consent at this time, but stated that, while a relationship with a minor under the age of 15 was illegal, it was not automatically considered statutory rape. Springora was not protected as were her European sisters. Matzneff was puffed up with self-justification, standing by his belief that his relationships with adolescent girls were helpful to them. We don&rsquo;t have to look far, though, to detect his self-serving motivations, and his manipulations and abuse of his power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When lying together in bed surrounded by books, Matzneff relayed the history of literature to the young Vanessa, only this history was conveniently specific to stories of older men with young muses; Edgar Allan Poe who married little Virginia when she was just 13, and Charles Dodgson (better know as Lewis Carroll) and his controversial photographs and obsession with Alice Liddell. One of the most shocking passages in Springora&rsquo;s book describes the first time Matzneff attempts to make love to her, and her body involuntarily rejects him &lsquo;[w]ith an instinctive reflex, my thighs jammed tight together&rsquo; &ndash; clearly telling her something that her emotions were not yet fully aware of. Instead of respecting this obvious sign &ndash; &lsquo;I howled with pain before he even touched me&rsquo; &ndash; he turned her over. &lsquo;That is how I lost the first part of my virginity,&rsquo; she writes. &lsquo;&lt;i&gt;Just like a little boy&lt;/i&gt;, he whispered to me in a soft voice.&rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matzneff used adolescent girls as muses, but also ventriloquised them as characters in his novels, cannibalising his relationships with them as well as the love letters they exchanged, all without permission. He stole their identities and remade them to serve his literary ego before they had even discovered their true selves. A decade before meeting Springora, he&rsquo;d had a three-year relationship with Francesca Gee, beginning when she was 15 years old, who, some years later, came across an illustration based on a photograph of herself on the cover of one of Matzneff&rsquo;s novels, &lt;i&gt;Ivre du vin perdu&lt;/i&gt; (1981; &lsquo;drunk on lost wine&rsquo;), strolling by a bookshop window. The novel follows a middle-aged man Nil and his seductions of 15-year-old girls, and trips to Manila where he pays to have sex with 11-year-old boys. For four decades, with no regard for her or attempt to obtain her consent, Gee&rsquo;s image was used to promote the kind of abusive relationships for which Matzneff is now being held to account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By using these young women&rsquo;s letters, Matzneff sought to demonstrate that a consensual love affair could happen between an adolescent and an adult, that love could transcend generations. Even now, in his senescence and facing a five-year prison sentence for sexual abuse, he marshals that cynical intellectual cover favoured by predators who target minors, and insists that Gee and Springora were two of the three loves of his life. These predators kindle an erotic storm by corresponding with these girls, then fan the flames by demanding their urgent response, and &lt;i&gt;voil&agrave;&lt;/i&gt; &ndash; here is the proof of the young girl&rsquo;s love for them. &lsquo;A letter leaves a trace,&rsquo; Springora writes, &lsquo;and the recipient feels duty-bound to respond, and when it is composed with passionate lyricism, she must show herself to be worthy of it.&rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2021-12-15 21:30:33', 48, 6179),

They won&rsquo;t be alone: Chinese, European and Russian space agencies have their sights on our nearest celestial body too, as do space companies such as Moon Express and Jeff Bezos&rsquo;s Blue Origin. If their plans come to fruition, astronauts and their robots will claim the most valuable spots and mine the Moon for water, ice and other resources. Our lunar neighbour will never be the same again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Moon is only a foothold, a first step on the edge of a vast landscape. Humanity stands on the brink of a new era of exploration, in which brief, intermittent and tentative space jaunts could be replaced by a multitude of cosmic activities conducted by many competing interests. Within 20 or 30 years, crewed missions could make giant leaps toward Mars &ndash; 500 times further away than the Moon &ndash; to map out the terrain and even establish colonies. Asteroids and other distant destinations will be next. With this new age dawning, we face a collective responsibility to consider the moral challenges before us, and to avoid committing the grave mistakes of the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, attitudes to space that focus on power and profit appear worryingly similar to the mindset of European and American colonial powers. The billionaire &lt;a href=&quot;https://aeon.co/essays/elon-musk-puts-his-case-for-a-multi-planet-civilisation&quot;&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt;&rsquo;s company SpaceX has begun transforming the night sky &ndash; the cultural heritage of humanity &ndash; with its reflective constellations of satellites. Military space programmes and military space companies continue developing space weapons such as anti-satellite missiles, tests of which increasingly clog low-Earth orbit with debris. Meanwhile, if companies or anyone else carves pieces of the Moon as they please, it could irrevocably change its appearance to us, too. While NASA and other space agencies are more accountable and transparent than the space industry, they too lack a collective, long-term roadmap for what comes next. Without clear guidelines for what can and cannot be done in space, the cosmos will become not a place for collaborative exploration and shared benefits but the site of conflicts, resource extraction and pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If nothing changes, commercial and military interests will influence or even supplant collective ones; the quest for resources such as water, minerals and valuable space in orbit will create imperatives to despoil the commons of space and the night sky; and investment in space exploration will become a way for the powerful to escape accountability for social justice problems on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing chorus of voices within the astronomy community is championing an alternative: a peaceful, sustainable and egalitarian vision of space, which keeps an eye on the injustices and inequalities on the ground. &lsquo;The larger philosophical question is &ldquo;Are other worlds there for human use or are they sovereign unto themselves?&rdquo;&rsquo; Lucianne Walkowicz, an astronomer at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, tells me. &lsquo;The viewpoint of European colonisers has always been that everything exists for their use, and we&rsquo;re witnessing the unsurprising outcome of centuries of that thinking.&rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walkowicz is driven by their longtime involvement in politics and activism, including opposition to the Iraq War and support for Black Lives Matter. After years of giving talks and raising awareness, Walkowicz and their colleagues recently formed the JustSpace Alliance &ndash; an organisation that advocates &lsquo;for a more inclusive and ethical future in space, and to harness visions of tomorrow for a more just and equitable world today&rsquo;, according to its mission statement. Other advocates and nonprofit organisations with aligned missions include Space Enabled, a research group at the MIT Media Lab, which promotes social and environmental sustainability in space, and applies space technology to foster justice on Earth; the Outer Space Institute, led by researchers at the University of British Columbia, which focuses on peace and sustainability in space, starting with the atmosphere; and the Secure World Foundation, a think-tank based in Broomfield, Colorado, aiming to reduce space conflicts and promote space diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With their overlapping objectives, these advocates and institutions want to spark a cultural shift that will reshape NASA&rsquo;s and other space agencies&rsquo; priorities and rein in the burgeoning space industry. Can they succeed?&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2021-12-15 21:45:36', 93, 363),

It was Good Friday, 2019, and their marriage had been over for some time. A holiday weekend, she figured, might deflect some of the attention she had been dreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Fucking idiot,&rdquo; she says of her plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/t/adele/&quot;&gt;Adele&lt;/a&gt; and her husband, Simon Konecki, had been together since 2011. Their relationship was remarkably under the radar given Adele&rsquo;s growing stardom, partly because she really only emerged from her life as a wife and mother to their son, Angelo, to release record-shattering albums. Their&amp;nbsp;wedding was so private there aren&rsquo;t even pictures online.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adele&rsquo;s dread only intensified after a press release went out that Good Friday evening. A close friend flew out from England to Los Angeles to make sure the then-30-year-old wasn&rsquo;t on her own as the news spread. Tweets and memes flooded social media, expressing not just shock that the relationship had ended, but also excitement at the idea that Adele&rsquo;s heartbreak would inspire new music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can understand where the fans were coming from. Adele built her empire on heartache: moving reflections of pain and its aftermath, like finding &ldquo;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/adele-someone-like-you-177403/&quot;&gt;Someone Like You&lt;/a&gt;,&rdquo; or merely saying &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; to an ex after years have passed. At the time Adele and Konecki announced their breakup, nearly four years had passed since her last album, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/adele-inside-her-private-life-and-triumphant-return-37131/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;25&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; and her audience was hungry for something new. And what&rsquo;s a better album prompt than a high-profile divorce?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Adele, the fan reaction was bewildering. &ldquo;During something like that, that kind of significant thing to happen in life, your mind sort of goes to those places: &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t they like me? Why would they write that if they&rsquo;ve followed me for 10 years?&rsquo; But in reality, that&rsquo;s not their responsibility. In reality, their responsibility as a fan is to want a good record and to hope I deliver. So I took it with a pinch of salt, and it was fine.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Adele knows a thing or two about waiting forever for a favorite artist to release new music, like her friend Kendrick Lamar. &ldquo;Fucking hell!&rdquo; she says of her anticipation for the rapper&rsquo;s next LP. Unlike her fans, she&rsquo;s already had the privilege of hearing a few of Lamar&rsquo;s new songs in the interim.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adele had enough to worry about besides Twitter and the expectation of new music. Rumors and assumptions spread like wildfire, but the reality is that there were no heroes or villains in her divorce. Konecki was a good husband and continues to be a great father to Angelo. He&rsquo;s still one of Adele&rsquo;s best friends, even texting her memes while she and I are together. Instead, the end came with the heartbreaking, if less dramatic, feeling that she was getting further from the person she hoped to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t really know myself,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I thought I did. I don&rsquo;t know if it was because of my Saturn return or if it was because I was well and truly sort of heading into my thirties, but I just didn&rsquo;t like who I was.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adele wanted to be settled and happy, in a home full of loving, organized chaos. She never really felt that, or at least she never felt truly present in it. &ldquo;It made me really sad,&rdquo; she recalls. &ldquo;Then having so many people that I don&rsquo;t know &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; that I didn&rsquo;t make that work &hellip; it fucking devastated me. I was embarrassed. No one made me feel embarrassed, but you feel like you didn&rsquo;t do a good job.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adele had already started writing the album everyone was waiting for. She began work on &lt;i&gt;30&lt;/i&gt; in early 2019 and had it completely written by early 2020, though the pandemic would have something to say about the eventual release date. Sure, it&rsquo;s an album about &ldquo;divorce, babe,&rdquo; as she stated recently in her first-ever Instagram Live. But it&rsquo;s not the collection of scorched-earth power ballads everyone may have been expecting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Adele wrote an open letter to Angelo, in hopes that one day he&rsquo;ll hear the album and really, truly understand who his mom was and how her life changed during this time. The only song specifically about her marriage is &ldquo;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/adele-easy-on-me-single-video-1242542/&quot;&gt;Easy on Me&lt;/a&gt;,&rdquo; the gorgeous, very typically Adele first single. Across &lt;i&gt;30,&lt;/i&gt; Adele assesses the most important relationship of her life: the one with herself. Saturn returns are periods of major upheaval at the turn of one&rsquo;s thirties, and Adele just went through hers, coming out on the other side of a turbulent period ready to reckon with who she is and what she wants, even if it meant upending her own life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/R1358_COV_Adele.jpg?w=844&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Produced by Brittany Brooks and Walaa Elsiddig.

It&rsquo;s the kind of thing the acerbic Brit might once have rolled her eyes at. It was exactly what she needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Good Friday announcement&lt;/strong&gt; sent Adele off on an intense few weeks of bed-bound anxiety. She was spending more nights on her own now that she and Konecki shared custody of Angelo. It was the most time she had ever spent away from her son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when she celebrated her 31st birthday with friends in May 2019, eating a home-cooked dinner and watching a movie, something clicked. &ldquo;I remember going upstairs, and doing my face, and getting into bed,&rdquo; she says. Her birthday fell a few weeks after that depressing Easter weekend. &ldquo;I felt quite hopeful,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It was the first time I felt I&rsquo;d had a really nice evening and I was OK being in the house and going to bed on my own. I was not excited, but I was looking forward to the next day.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day, she woke up to the California sun pouring through her curtains and &ldquo;saw this tsunami of emotions&rdquo; coming toward her. She thought that maybe she would try to be busy. Instead, she stayed in bed and started watching &lt;i&gt;The Sopranos.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I was like, &lsquo;This is going to be really fucking up-and-down,&rsquo;&rdquo; she says. And it was. But after the great birthday and rough comedown of a morning after, she decided to spend 2019 trying new things. She took recommendations from anyone &mdash; her lifelong London crew, industry allies, other moms at Angelo&rsquo;s school, even her eyelash girl. She entered her &ldquo;sound bath era&rdquo; and began hiking regularly. That July, she climbed a mountain in Idaho with friends, where they wrote their intentions and buried them in the dirt. She gave up drinking for about six months, tired of the constant &ldquo;hangxiety.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2021-12-15 21:33:40', 839, 38821);

According to Nietzsche, the ancient Greeks had once mastered a healthy cultural balance between the &lsquo;Apollonian&rsquo; impulse toward rational control and the &lsquo;Dionysian&rsquo; desire for ecstatic surrender. From the 5th century BCE onward, however, Western intellectual culture has consistently skewed in favour of Apollonian rationalism to the neglect of the Dionysian &ndash; an imbalance from which it has never recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary villain of this story was Plato, whom Nietzsche accused of setting philosophy on its rationalist track. Plato&rsquo;s immortalisation of his teacher, Socrates, amounted to nothing less than a morbid obsession with intellectual martyrdom. His Theory of the Forms taught generations of philosophers to seek truth in metaphysical abstractions, while devaluing lived experiences in the physical world. Plato&rsquo;s intellectual revolution, in particular, was born out of the destruction of myth. In his wake, philosophy had been left &lsquo;stripped of myth&rsquo; and starved of cultural roots. Modern culture, for Nietzsche, continued to languish in the shadow of Plato&rsquo;s legacy, still grappling with its &lsquo;loss of myth, the loss of a mythical home, a mythical, maternal womb&rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven decades later, at the end of the Second World War, Karl Popper mounted what would become, after Nietzsche, the second-most famous attack on Plato in modern philosophy. In &lt;i&gt;The Open Society and Its Enemies&lt;/i&gt; (1945), Popper suggested that Plato had provided Western thought with its first blueprint of the &lsquo;closed society&rsquo;. In the &lt;i&gt;Republic&lt;/i&gt;, Plato envisioned an ideal city that prioritises the harmony of the collective over the freedom of individuals, the preservation of the status quo over innovation, and the authority of intellectual gatekeepers over democracy and truth. The toxic influence of Plato&rsquo;s political vision, Popper argued, could be traced through the history of philosophy, all the way to Nazi Germany and other forms of contemporary totalitarianism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Nietzsche, Popper blamed Plato for setting Western philosophy on the wrong course. He did so, however, for precisely the opposite reason. Popper&rsquo;s Plato was no rationalist. Rather, Popper boiled down the difference between open and closed societies to the difference between a culture of criticism and a culture of myth. Plato, as the first and the greatest of the enemies of the open society, had advocated the suppression of free criticism in order to establish an &lsquo;arrested state&rsquo;, sustained by myths and deception. Pointing to the &lt;i&gt;Republic&lt;/i&gt;&rsquo;s controversial foundation narrative, the Myth of Metals, Popper credited Plato with writing an &lsquo;exact counterpart&rsquo; to &lsquo;the modern myth of Blood and Soil&rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who was right? Was Plato a short-sighted rationalist, who led philosophy astray by unmooring it from a more authentic, mythic past? Or was he a devious mythmaker, who introduced an uneasy current of irrationalism into the citadel of reason? How could he be both? Put differently: was Plato to blame for steering philosophy away from myth, or for bringing it closer to myth?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither &lt;i&gt;The Birth of Tragedy&lt;/i&gt; nor &lt;i&gt;The Open Society&lt;/i&gt; is celebrated today for its author&rsquo;s fidelity to historical accuracy. Nonetheless, both remain iconic because Nietzsche and Popper were each on to something resonant about the relationship between myth and philosophy, and the curious symbolic role of Plato in our inherited understandings of that relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To some extent, both their critiques were right, in the fractured way everyone is a little right in the parable about the blind men and the elephant. Plato continues to be celebrated as a figure who set philosophy on a rational foundation by isolating a distinctly rigorous, critical mode of reasoning from the clutches of myth and received wisdom. And yet, his dialogues are also run through with myths of his own invention: the Myth of Metals, the &lt;i&gt;Symposium&lt;/i&gt;&rsquo;s account of the origin of love, and the stories about the afterlife which close the &lt;i&gt;Phaedo&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Gorgias&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Republic&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Squaring both these aspects of Plato&rsquo;s thought is difficult because we remain wedded to two distinct, but related, ideas in our intellectual heritage. The first is the idea that philosophy is fundamentally opposed to myth. And the second is that it was Plato who first pointed this out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerns about myth are often bound up with concerns about misinformation. But these anxieties go beyond a worry about factual inaccuracies that require correction. Rather, when scholars and commentators designate something as a myth, they are usually grappling with a more existential threat: a symbolically powerful narrative that seems immune to correction altogether, but that, nonetheless, has the power to captivate our imaginations. The language of myth, for instance, has recently been used to talk about frontier imagery in US immigration policy &ndash; &lsquo;the myth of the border wall&rsquo; &ndash; as well as nostalgic appeals to a somehow more authentic version of a nation&rsquo;s people &ndash; from the &lsquo;myth of a &ldquo;real&rdquo; America&rsquo;, to the &lsquo;myths of Englishness&rsquo; that made rounds during the Brexit campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reason myths make us uneasy is that we expect them not to have a place at the heart of the assumptions and beliefs that found modern culture. That is, there is an expectation that we, as a society, ought to have &lt;i&gt;outgrown&lt;/i&gt; myths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This expectation stems from an evolutionary account of culture that goes back at least to ancient Greece, when Presocratic thinkers adopted rhetoric that distinguished their methods of investigation from the oral tradition associated with ancient myths about the Olympian deities, by focusing on the unverifiable nature of such stories. But it was in 18th-century Europe that myth came to be seen as a cultural relic that was fundamentally at odds with modern life. As the Enlightenment railed against tradition and superstition, authors such as Pierre Bayle and Bernard de Fontenelle turned their attention to the legacy of Greco-Roman myths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In preceding centuries, classical mythology had been treated by their Baroque aficionados as part of a timeless heritage, an inherited aesthetic vocabulary that educated individuals had to learn in order to participate in high culture. The Enlightenment critics, by contrast, were eager to question the value of the myths that their predecessors had deemed worthy of valorising in their sculptures, paintings, operas and even ceiling decoration. Instead, Enlightenment authors drew attention to the absurd, often grotesque, features of these same myths. With obvious relish, Bayle detailed the episodes of adultery, incest and cannibalism that littered classical mythology, and mocked the ancient commentators, who had tried to provide allegorical explanations for them. &lsquo;They cannot be read,&rsquo; he judged, &lsquo;without feeling pity for those philosophers who used their time so badly.&rsquo; Fontenelle, for his part, speculated that the Olympian deities of thunder and the seas were merely what the ancient Greeks had conjured up in their imaginations in order to explain natural phenomena that they lacked the scientific knowledge to comprehend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The course of philosophy can be understood as a trajectory that runs from &lsquo;from &lt;i&gt;mythos&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;logos&lt;/i&gt;&rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was another reason for the Enlightenment re-evaluation of classical mythology. Travel accounts from Asia, North Africa and the New World had introduced European audiences to mythological traditions beyond those of ancient Greece and Rome. As the first comparative mythologists began spotting similarities between classical myths and those from cultures that many Europeans at the time considered barbaric, the former lost much of their traditional lustre. They weren&rsquo;t so special after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What emerged from these cultural reappraisals was a formula for conceptualising civilisational progress as a linear trajectory, pointing firmly away from myth. As 18th-century Europeans came to understand it, societies with rich mythological cultures &ndash; such as those of Greco-Roman antiquity, but also those of contemporary Indigenous peoples in the New World and elsewhere &ndash; occupied a &lsquo;primitive&rsquo; stage of culture. By comparison, their own enlightened society had successfully shed its myths and superstitions in favour of more rigorous ways of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A crucial part of this account of cultural evolution was a focus on the cognitive development of the human mind. The path from barbarism to civilisation supposedly also entailed a transformation in the character of thought itself &ndash; from the kind of credulous, superstitious mentality it takes to generate and believe in myths, to the Enlightenment mind capable of criticism and the evaluation of arguments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This model of epistemic development had enduring effects on the self-identity of philosophy. The course of philosophy, to borrow a formulation by the 20th-century classicist Wilhelm Nestle, can be understood in terms of a trajectory that runs from &lsquo;from &lt;i&gt;mythos&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;logos&lt;/i&gt;&rsquo;. On this view, philosophers continue the work of breaking away from myth, identifying the ones that remain operative in our thinking and culture, subjecting them to critical interrogation, and replacing them with knowledge that stands up to critical scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was also during the 18th century that Plato came to be adopted as the original champion of philosophy&rsquo;s long and ongoing battle against myth. In preceding centuries, Europeans would have been more familiar with a rather different portrait of Plato. This was the account of Plato&rsquo;s thought given by Neoplatonism. Adherents of this wide-ranging philosophical tradition, which first flourished in late antiquity and was revived in Renaissance Italy, saw in Plato&rsquo;s scattered writings a radically coherent metaphysical system, arranged around a highest, unifying Form of goodness. Neoplatonic interpretations of Plato&rsquo;s philosophy often had a mystical bent &ndash; acquired, in part, as it gradually negotiated for itself a place alongside Christian orthodoxy. In order to reassure Christians, who were wary of granting too much influence to a pagan, Neoplatonists insisted that Plato had been divinely inspired as a prophetic instrument of God&rsquo;s design for human history. Pointing to Plato&rsquo;s descriptions of divine poetic inspiration in the &lt;i&gt;Ion&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Phaedrus&lt;/i&gt;, they argued that Plato himself was aware of his own role as a vessel of a higher power. Such readings of Plato gained an esoteric flavour. They elevated the role of inspiration over that of reason, and they tended to focus on themes such as enthusiasm, love or &ndash; especially in the context of Renaissance humanism &ndash; the divine gift of eloquence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Enlightenment thinkers such as Voltaire and his associates turned to Plato, however, they often did so in the spirit of a far older interpretive tradition, one that long predated the Neoplatonists. This was academic scepticism, which had been the dominant school of thought in Plato&rsquo;s Academy from the 4th century BCE &ndash; about three generations after Plato&rsquo;s death &ndash; and lasted into the 1st century BCE. Where the coherence of Plato&rsquo;s metaphysical system was a central tenet of the Neoplatonic tradition, academic sceptics denied that Plato had any system of philosophy at all. Rather, their Plato was the antisystematist par excellence, resisting dogma at all costs in favour of the critical suspension of judgment. Plato&rsquo;s sceptic interpreters emphasised the mercilessly rigorous nature of Socratic interrogation and the inconclusive endings of some of the early dialogues, which seemed to represent a disavowal of certain knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plato&rsquo;s portrayal of the Socratic gadfly helped model an Enlightenment ideal of philosophical citizenship&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sceptic portrait of Plato was especially appealing to Plato&rsquo;s Enlightenment readers, who similarly adopted a principled programme of challenging authority and questioning received knowledge. Plato&rsquo;s critique of Greek mythological tradition, in particular, proved newly resonant. Voltaire praised Plato&rsquo;s portrayal of Socrates as a proto-scientific philosopher persecuted for proving &lsquo;that the Moon was not a goddess, and that Mercury was not a god&rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enlightenment champions of Plato were unwilling, at the same time, to accept the fully sceptic conclusion that certain knowledge was impossible. Eventually, they negotiated a compromise between the Neoplatonist and sceptic accounts of Plato. They accepted that Plato had a coherent philosophical system, and that constructive and certain knowledge was indeed possible. But the path to knowledge was not through revelation or inspiration, but through the kind of critical reason that the academic sceptics so prized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plato&rsquo;s Enlightenment readers also took him to be an embodiment of their own political values. His portrayal of the Socratic gadfly helped model an ideal of philosophical citizenship &ndash; of citizens as critical thinkers, refusing to take social norms for granted, but instead exposing unfounded pretences to knowledge and the vague and mystifying myths of society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dominance and popularity of the Enlightenment portrait of Plato meant that the interpretations that had preceded it largely fell out of sight, and naturally de-emphasised those aspects of Plato&rsquo;s thought that sat poorly with its portrait. This was the process by which the rationalist Plato, so despised by Nietzsche, was created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Plato was not just the champion of rational argument that the Enlightenment presented him to be. His dialogues, significantly, contained myths: carefully constructed narrative interludes, woven into the philosophical investigation, that reworked or mimicked existing material from the Greek mythological tradition. We might take, for instance, the Myth of Metals &ndash; the myth that Popper compared to Nazi ideology &ndash; which tells the story of a race of citizens being crafted beneath the earth. A god, according to the myth, mixed metals into their makeup: gold for those most naturally equipped to be rulers, silver for the assistants to the rulers, and iron and bronze in the farmers and the craftsmen. Plato&rsquo;s first readers would have recognised this myth as an original reinvention of the Hesiodic myth of ages (humans &lt;a href=&quot;https://aeon.co/ideas/even-the-ancient-greeks-thought-their-best-days-were-history&quot;&gt;decline&lt;/a&gt; in character as they pass through the ages of gold, silver, bronze and iron) and the myth of the founding of Thebes by Cadmus (a race of men is born out of the earth).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plato&rsquo;s myths tend to be stylistically differentiated from the closely argued investigations that make up the rest of his dialogues. They are often set in fantastical worlds &ndash; like the subterranean workshop of the deity in the Myth of Metals, or the eschatological landscapes in Plato&rsquo;s myths about the afterlife &ndash; and they are not held to the standards of argument otherwise championed in Plato&rsquo;s work. The myths are simply just-so stories, presented without any attempt to justify them with reasons or facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In certain Neoplatonic traditions that celebrated the more mystical aspects of Plato&rsquo;s thought, these myths were considered an important facet of his work. The Enlightenment reinterpretation of Plato, by contrast, had no good way of accounting for them. If Plato is the original liberator of philosophy from myth, his own use of myths seems hypocritical at worst and, at best, a failure to live up to a standard of critical rigour that he himself invented for philosophy. As the 18th-century portrait of the rationalist Plato gained ground, the myths began to be awkwardly ignored, or else dismissed as the vestiges of ancient tradition in the work of a philosopher who paved the eventual path to the age of Enlightenment, without having been fully enlightened himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Enlightenment Plato is, by and large, the one we have inherited today, who coexists uneasily in our imaginations with the mythmaking Plato we encounter when we read his texts. This unresolved tension is a reminder of what gets missed when we take only the most readily available Plato in our heritage for granted. The old Enlightenment narrative can often blind us to the philosophical value of Plato&rsquo;s myths. Popper, for instance, had accused Plato of deploying myths for purely political, propagandistic purposes, which were ultimately at odds with the values of philosophy itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plato was attesting to the power of myth to reshape the stories we take for granted&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what Popper didn&rsquo;t realise was that Plato often turned to myth in ways that were complementary, rather than antithetical, to the kind of critical reasoning exhibited in the more argumentative parts of his writing. Plato&rsquo;s myths end up being a distinct form of philosophical discourse in their own right, exploring aspects of our worldviews that are so deeply ingrained that they are difficult to pick apart solely through critical reason. The Myth of Metals does not just make sweeping claims about what individuals are and are not naturally suited for. It also prompts a philosophical reimagination of the very concept of nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Myth of Metals appears at a particular juncture in Socrates&rsquo; description of the education of the citizens of the city envisioned in the &lt;i&gt;Republic&lt;/i&gt;. It is intended to be told to the citizens after they have completed a basic preliminary education in music and gymnastics, at which point they are to be sorted into the various occupational classes of the city. The myth has long been read, along Popperian lines, as a piece of political propaganda appealing to the notion that individuals have natures that, like race, are determined from birth, and equip them better for certain roles in society than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if the myth tells a story built on the idea that the natures of individuals are fixed in a particularly rigid way from birth, it is also a story involving a total reconceptualisation of what it means to be born in the first place. The opening lines of the myth invite the citizens to think of their rearing and education up to this point in their lives as a dream. According to the myth, the citizens have not yet truly lived. They have instead been asleep through the years of their early upbringing, gestating inside the womb of their mother, the earth, while their natures were being formed. Only when this process was complete were they released above ground and made to wake from their long slumber. Citizens are not truly born, the myth suggests, until they have completed the first stage of their education. The natures of citizens, accordingly, have to be defined, not in terms of the attributes they have at the beginning of their biological lives, but by those they possess at the end of a basic education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In borrowing from the conventions of Greek mythology to create his own philosophical myths, Plato was attesting to the power of myth to reach, and to reshape, the stories we take for granted about our natural and social world. Such stories, in turn, can provide a stable imaginative framework of values and expectations for organising political experiences in meaningful ways, and can be vital to framing the way we think about our environment and our places in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plato&rsquo;s myths, read without the baggage of the Enlightenment narratives told about him, serve as a reminder that myth did not always stand for the opposite of philosophy. Plato was himself well aware of the dangers of myth. But this awareness was part of a broader appreciation of its power and its possibilities, one that recognised the full range of myth&rsquo;s potential to be both harmful &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; constructive for philosophy and politics. Above all, Plato&rsquo;s understanding of myth stemmed from the position that our worldviews are underpinned by deeper, more elusive narratives that may be more easily accessed and shaped by the mechanisms of myth than those of rational argument. This insight was something that Plato applied to philosophers themselves. As Socrates suggests to his interlocutors in the &lt;i&gt;Republic&lt;/i&gt;, the long process of educating the philosopher-guardians of their ideal city must be approached &lsquo;as if we were at leisure and telling myths&rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we don&rsquo;t take this idea seriously enough, and we focus on myth only in its most pathological forms. One consequence of the Enlightenment idea of civilisational progress is that, when myths do rear their heads in modern society, they seem to suggest that a regression has taken place. Such was the alarmed response in the 20th century when fascism spread around Europe. As Nazi propagandists peddled grand narratives about the destiny of a chosen race of people, kingdoms that would last a thousand years, and even constructed elaborate genealogies around Plato&rsquo;s myth of Atlantis, contemporary commentators diagnosed the phenomenon as a deplorable &lsquo;resurgence&rsquo; of myth in modern politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myths are not monoliths impervious to change, but dynamic stories open to reinterpretation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, contemporary critics of myth have good reason to argue that these might not be possibilities worth exploring. Postwar attitudes toward myth, shaped by the reckoning with Nazism, have inured us to a kind of anti-myth vigilance: if the horrors of Nazism are the cost of permitting myths to thrive in modern politics, this may be too high a cost to bear, no matter the potential benefits. To borrow a phrase from the 17th-century poet John Dryden, myth may well represent &lsquo;a world well lost&rsquo;. On this view, the stance that we, as a society, ought to be taking toward contemporary forms of myth should either be a principled refusal of acknowledgement &ndash; lest doing so legitimises them, or opens the floodgates to further irrationality &ndash; or a constant readiness to combat them, whenever they occur, with an arsenal of facts and reasoned arguments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lessons of Plato&rsquo;s myths, however, point us to another way. If we remain allergic to the presence of myths in our cultural landscape, we miss the larger point, and risk throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Plato&rsquo;s insight was that myth is a powerful, enduring force in politics and culture &ndash; a point of common ground in both Nietzsche&rsquo;s and Popper&rsquo;s critiques of Plato. Not taking this seriously risks falling into denialism about the very real ways in which such symbolically rich narratives influence our worldviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Plato&rsquo;s own philosophical reinvention of myth also suggests that myths can be reworked in creative ways. Myths are not monoliths impervious to change, but dynamic stories open to reinterpretation every time they are retold. Our inherited aversion to myth not only keeps us from fully appreciating Plato&rsquo;s incisive understanding of myth. It also keeps us from recognising &ndash; and learning from &ndash; people in our own communities who are already doing the kind of creative work it takes to engage constructively with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 2016, representatives from more than 300 Native American tribes gathered together at a campsite near Cannon Ball in North Dakota to protest the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. The proposed oil pipeline was to run perilously close to land that belonged to the Standing Rock reservation, including under Lake Oahe, the reservation&rsquo;s primary source of water and the site of several locations sacred to the Sioux who live there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially dismissed as routine protesters &ndash; as any construction project of that scale is likely to generate &ndash; the activist groups themselves came to understand their work differently. They drew upon Native mythological traditions to reframe the significance of the moment, which in turn supplied a new conceptual vocabulary for their self-understanding as a community. A Lakota prophecy foretold of a time when the various tribes would come together in the &lsquo;seventh generation&rsquo; to save their peoples and the Earth from destruction. For the activists at Standing Rock, that moment was now. Their common task was a duty that linked them to their ancestors, who had seen themselves as stewards of the environment. The activists at the makeshift camps by the construction site &ndash; the newly anointed Sacred Stone Camp &ndash; were not protesters at all: they were water protectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The water protectors at Standing Rock are separated a long way, in geography and time, from Plato. Not only was Plato an Athenian, who lived nearly 2.5 millennia ago; he has long been the paradigmatic Dead White Man, the figurehead of an intellectual canon that has excluded the voices of peoples such as those at Sacred Stone Camp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Plato&rsquo;s point is that the unlikely insight he shared with the water protectors at Standing Rock is a lesson for philosophers as well. If myths turned out to be an inescapable part of modern life, Plato teaches us not to despair that our Enlightenment expectations of rational progress have gone unmet. Instead, he invites us to make theoretical space for the myths around us, and to remember our own capacity to rework them.&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2021-12-15 21:15:48', 1, 37777),

At his death in 1831, he was the reigning voice in German philosophy. His followers, however, soon split into opposed camps: the Right Hegelians, a conservative and religious group, and the Left Hegelians, a socially radical group including Karl Marx. Amid their squabbles, Hegel&rsquo;s star began to fade in Germany. But in the late 19th century, it once again rose to prominence in the rest of Europe and in the United States. Certain strains of 20th-century Continental philosophy were deeply marked by his influence, such as French existentialism and the Frankfurt school of critical theory. But 20th-century Anglophone philosophy reacted strongly against the neo-Hegelian thought that dominated the universities at the end of the 19th century. In English-speaking lands (including the US), Hegel has lived under a cloud for the past century: his writing too dense, his ideas too abstract, his politics as well as his theology too suspect. His works have been treated with derision in mainstream Anglophone philosophy, and excluded from the canon that trained philosophers need to master.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The logjam that blocked English-language Hegel studies, however, is finally crumbling, and a number of Americans are leading the way. Again, Hegel&rsquo;s star rises. It isn&rsquo;t outlandish to suggest that the new openness to Hegel marks an important inflection point in US philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hegel&rsquo;s reception in the US has long been complicated. In the mid-to-late 19th century, he was widely read and respected. There were several well-established groups, often heavy with German immigrants, dedicated to Hegel study, such as the Ohio and the St Louis Hegelians. There were prominent Hegelian Idealists in the universities, notably Josiah Royce at Harvard and G Watts Cunningham at Cornell. And, perhaps most important, several Pragmatists, especially &lt;a href=&quot;https://aeon.co/essays/charles-sanders-peirce-was-americas-greatest-thinker&quot;&gt;Charles S Peirce&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://aeon.co/essays/dewey-knew-how-to-teach-democracy-and-we-must-not-forget-it&quot;&gt;John Dewey&lt;/a&gt;, were influenced by Hegel. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://aeon.co/ideas/how-william-james-encourages-us-to-believe-in-the-possible&quot;&gt;William James&lt;/a&gt; was not a Hegel fan.) Then the reaction set in. It started in England, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://aeon.co/videos/a-fanatic-against-fanaticism-and-other-pleasures-of-bertrand-russell-in-his-own-words&quot;&gt;Bertrand Russell&lt;/a&gt; and G E Moore&rsquo;s revolt against the British Idealists, but the Americans picked up the banner and then doubled down on the rejection of Hegel with the infusion of logical positivists escaping Nazi Germany in the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d2e1bqvws99ptg.cloudfront.net/user_image_upload/1658/insert-1407712658_b030948617_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portrait of G W F Hegel (1831) by Jakob Schlesinger at the Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Photo courtesy Marcel Molina Jr/Flickr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anglophone philosophy turned against Hegel for several reasons. His philosophy was seen as the epitome of a grand metaphysical system purporting to lay out a priori the fundamental structure of reality, which turned out to be &lt;i&gt;mental&lt;/i&gt;, or in Hegel&rsquo;s vocabulary, &lt;i&gt;spiritual&lt;/i&gt; &ndash; something like a &lt;i&gt;world soul&lt;/i&gt;, or (even worse), a Spinozistic, pantheistic &lt;i&gt;God&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, not only was Hegel&rsquo;s system grandiose metaphysics, it was grandiose theology as well. Hegel also defended a holism that conflicted with the atomism (and the foundationalistic theory of knowledge) that comes naturally with empiricism and which seemed to be a lesson taught by modern science. Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy opposed the antimetaphysical, atomistic, foundationalist and empiricist bent of Anglophone philosophy, which was also increasingly secular in orientation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a slightly less abstract level, Anglophone philosophy had become enamoured of the developments in logic initiated by George Boole, Gottlob Frege, and Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead. Investigations into logic, generalised into the philosophy of language, became &lt;i&gt;first philosophy&lt;/i&gt; in Anglophone lands. From this perspective, Hegel&rsquo;s logic (arguably the heart of his philosophy) was either terribly retrograde or, in all its talk about &lt;i&gt;dialectic&lt;/i&gt;, hardly intelligible. And last, the obscurity of Hegel&rsquo;s writing made rejecting Hegelian philosophy all the easier. After all, who could tell what he was actually saying?&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2021-12-15 21:16:37', 377, 2777);

Most of these organisms disappeared through the constant shuffle of ecological and evolutionary change. But not all. Many species have vanished in a geological snap during mass extinctions &ndash; truly catastrophic events where the rate of extinction vastly outpaces the origin of new species. For a time, these ecological disasters were thought to drive a great flourish of new lifeforms in the aftermath. It turns out that supposition is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider the cataclysm that ended the Cretaceous Period around 66 million years ago. A chunk of space rock more than 7 miles wide smacked into what&rsquo;s now the Yucat&aacute;n Peninsula. The debris and ejecta thrown into the atmosphere heated up on the way back down, causing oven-like temperatures all over the planet before a chilly post-impact winter settled in, almost halting photosynthesis for three years. Before the impact, the likes of &lt;i&gt;Tyrannosaurus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Triceratops&lt;/i&gt; were thriving. After, only birds were left to carry on the legacy of the &lsquo;terrible lizards&rsquo; in what would eventually be called the Age of Mammals. The impact, palaeontologists used to argue, toppled dinosaurs from dominance and allowed our mammalian relatives and ancestors to thrive. A mass extinction, in other words, was the prerequisite for a new evolutionary burst that featured mammals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the classic tale of extinction and recovery doesn&rsquo;t hold up anymore. What the fossil record tells us about the nature of life on Earth does not line up with the traditional view in which mass extinctions refresh life&rsquo;s diversity as if they were blazes required to reinvigorate fire-adapted forests. Life&rsquo;s greatest radiations, palaeontologists are learning, were decoupled from mass extinctions. Instead, those radiations seem to have come when organisms transcended anatomical and environmental barriers to inhabit a new niche. The origin of complex eyes, the interplay of species as some organisms became adapted to land, and similar events were far more important than mass extinction to evolution&rsquo;s most vigorous moments in time &ndash; a testament to the complexity of our planet&rsquo;s biodiversity and a warning for life&rsquo;s future on this planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The very concept of extinction is relatively recent. Consider the fate of the dodo. The large, ground-dwelling pigeons found on the island of Mauritius were extremely vulnerable to the rats, dogs and pigs European sailors brought with them &ndash; not to mention the depredations of the seafarers themselves. In less than a century, the dodo was entirely exterminated &ndash; the most commonly accepted date for the bird&rsquo;s demise is 1662. And yet, despite the fact that humans both caused and witnessed extinction firsthand, many naturalists doubted that extinction was even possible. It wasn&rsquo;t until 1799, more than 100 years later, that extinction was finally accepted as an inescapable facet of nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fossils provided the key. While interpretations of these petrified remnants by early naturalists in Europe verged on the fanciful in order to square the fossil record with Christian scripture &ndash; for example, that fossils are merely imitations of life that grow inside the rock of their own accord &ndash; by the late 18th century it was accepted that fossils were the remains of ancient creatures. But this, by itself, did not prove extinction. The 18th century was a burgeoning era of exploration and colonialism, and naturalists were awed by just how varied and strange the world was. Perhaps some of the giant elephants or enormous sloths might be wandering some distant grassland or unseen forest. But by 1800, the work of a young French anatomist named Georges Cuvier put the proverbial nail in the coffin of the subject of extinction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cuvier&rsquo;s studies had trained him in comparative anatomy, a relatively new science that focused on reading animal bodies to understand the organisation of nature. During his research, he pored over the remains of an elephant-like animal found in Siberia, as well as the skeletal remains of a similar animal dubbed the &lsquo;American &lt;i&gt;incognitum&lt;/i&gt;&rsquo;. Until that time, such remains were either considered to be the bones of elephants that had wandered to unusual latitudes when the world was warmer, or clues to rare species still awaiting discovery, alive, in some distant part of the world. But Cuvier convincingly argued that the bones of the Siberian animal and the American creature were not only different from each other, but distinct from any living species. More than that, Cuvier noted, these were large animals that would be unlikely to go unnoticed during a time when natural observations and study specimens were pouring into Europe from all over the globe. Species could go extinct, and already had been long before humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life certainly changed over time, but it seemed to do so in a progressive and orderly fashion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional finds quickly bolstered the point. Another animal intimately familiar to Cuvier &ndash; &lt;i&gt;Mosasaurus&lt;/i&gt; &ndash; was a gigantic sea lizard unlike anything swimming in modern waters. No one had seen anything quite like the giant sloth &lt;i&gt;Megatherium&lt;/i&gt; alive among the pampas of Argentina, either. Stranger still were creatures that in 1842 would be dubbed the dinosaurs, reptiles that did not look like any lizard or crocodile. Nevertheless, during palaeontology&rsquo;s early development, there was no sense of Deep Time or how ancient the world truly was. It was impossible to say precisely how old Earth might be and when these bizarre creatures lived. All palaeontologists were left with was the appearance of progress through time, the layers of Earth&rsquo;s rocks seeming to fall into an Age of Fishes, an Age of Reptiles, and an Age of Mammals. (Only in 1859 did naturalists begin to concede that &lt;i&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/i&gt;, too, had a fossil record.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life certainly changed over time, but it seemed to do so in a progressive and orderly fashion neatly arranged along a trajectory of lower to higher vertebrates. Even though some experts &ndash; such as Cuvier himself &ndash; advocated for intermittent catastrophes that ended one age and ushered in another, many naturalists took a different view. Life evolved and went extinct like clockwork, a constant and persistent turnover as gradual as the erosion of a rock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It didn&rsquo;t take long for cracks to form in these classic notions of extinction. In fact, in the decades between the publication of Charles Darwin&rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;On the Origin of Species&lt;/i&gt; (1859) and the modern evolutionary synthesis (combining Darwin with ideas about genetics) that coalesced in the 1940s, palaeontologists proposed some wild ideas. Some played with notions of orthogenesis, or the idea that groups of organisms had internal life-timers &ndash; just like individuals &ndash; that dictated birth, growth and death. In the book &lt;i&gt;The Origin&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Significance of Spines&lt;/i&gt; (1898), for example, the American palaeontologist Charles Emerson Beecher argued that the coil-shelled squid cousins called ammonites got spinier and spinier over time &ndash; a term he called &lsquo;spinescence&rsquo;. That showed how natural systems broke down as a group of organisms self-destructed. Dinosaurs, too, were prime examples of the trend. Many of them were large, strange and lavishly ornamented, and they had all disappeared to make way for the superior mammals. With orthogenesis in play, there was no need to understand extinction as an ecological process or something that could happen suddenly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But by the latter half of the 20th century, the modern synthesis had put natural selection back at the centre of evolutionary considerations, and old ideas about orthogenesis and &lsquo;spinescence&rsquo; were tossed out. Instead, finally, extinction was understood as an inevitable phenomenon influenced by alterations to an organism&rsquo;s environment. During the 1980s in particular, the burgeoning science of palaeobiology started to look beyond individual fossil finds for broader patterns in life&rsquo;s history. By looking at the comings and goings of oceanic invertebrates, for example, researchers such as David Raup and John Sepkoski &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.215.4539.1501&quot;&gt;discerned&lt;/a&gt; that there were at least five dramatic extinction waves, or &lsquo;pulses&rsquo;, when species vanished en masse. The pattern was observed in the terrestrial realm, too, underscoring that Earth&rsquo;s biodiversity had repeatedly gone through crashes and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, palaeontologists began to realise how these events cleared the ecological decks and allowed new forms of life to arise. Consider the worst mass extinction of all time, the end-Permian mass extinction that occurred around 252 million years ago. Prior to that event, the world was brimming with complex ecosystems &ndash; from ancient ocean reefs to forests prowled by protomammals. Then, intense volcanic activity triggered severe global changes ranging from ocean acidification to depleted oxygen in the atmosphere, resulting in about 70 per cent of land-dwelling species and more than 90 per cent of marine species going extinct. In the following time period, the Triassic, reptiles &ndash; &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsbl.2012.0949&quot;&gt;including&lt;/a&gt; the earliest dinosaurs &ndash; replaced the protomammals as the dominant vertebrates on land. A mass extinction had lopped off numerous branches of the tree of life, allowing the survivors to evolve in new ways as life&rsquo;s biodiversity refreshed itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life on Earth seemed to be cut back by catastrophe, and then emerge from the ashes more varied and vigorous than before. Mass extinctions reshaped nature, it seemed, shuffling off ancient lineages and allowing new forms to burst forth. The Age of Fishes, the Age of Reptiles and the Age of Mammals that early palaeontologists perceived didn&rsquo;t mark life&rsquo;s ascension, but the legacy of mass extinctions &ndash; each new age representing how life had come back in fuller force. That evolution would be reinvigorated after the decimation of many species seemed to be intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They didn&rsquo;t find a neat relationship between extinction and increased biodiversity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the fossil record no longer bears out this pattern of devastation and vigorous renewal. Even though what we know of prehistoric life comes to us in fragments &ndash; a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of all life that ever lived &ndash; palaeontologists have been able to at least outline the ebb and flow of life through time. The trend doesn&rsquo;t match the classic narratives around mass extinctions. In most cases, the times when life truly thrived were decoupled from mass extinctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, palaeontologists have catalogued literally millions of fossil occurrences in the Paleobiology Database, an immense store of information that outlines the shape of life through time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By drawing on this information, the data scientist Jennifer Hoyal Cuthill at the University of Essex and colleagues &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-3003-4&quot;&gt;used&lt;/a&gt; machine learning to track major shifts in species diversity over the past 541 million years. The mark of biodiversity disasters was unmistakable. The researchers noticed the traditional Big Five mass extinctions, as well as an additional seven. Broadscale catastrophes are not nearly as rare as had been previously thought. But when the scientists looked at when life bloomed, they didn&rsquo;t find a neat relationship between extinction and increased biodiversity. Of 17 events that the researchers called &lsquo;mass radiations&rsquo; of life, only two seemed to be associated with a mass extinction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the times that stood out in the new analysis is a slice of prehistory known as the Carboniferous. Hoyal Cuthill and colleagues noticed a major diversity spike at around 358 million years ago, at the beginning of the period. This was a time when new plant species were rapidly evolving on land, providing entirely new ecosystems for terrestrial invertebrates &ndash; from ancient millipedes to dragonflies &ndash; and the amphibious vertebrates that lurked at the water&rsquo;s edge, looking for insects to munch. Life transcended the aquatic realm to come ashore, with entirely novel ecosystems taking root. There&rsquo;s no evidence that a mass extinction had anything to do with this burst. The last mass extinction was more than 7 million years earlier, too ancient to have spurred the profusion of plants and animals that evolved to thrive on land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there was something else, perhaps easy to miss on first glance. Hoyal Cuthill and her co-authors didn&rsquo;t just look at when mass extinctions or radiations occurred. They also examined when species appear and disappear from the fossil record to get some sense of how sharp each of these changes were. During the Cambrian Explosion of 541 million years ago, for example, 87 per cent of known species first appear in the fossil record and only about 12 per cent of species disappear. Just like the name suggests, the Cambrian Explosion was a major burst of evolutionary novelty. But when the researchers looked for the event&rsquo;s inverse &ndash; a time when most species go extinct and few appear &ndash; the closest they could find was the end-Permian mass extinction that occurred 289 million years later, when 73 per cent of species went extinct and only 19 per cent appeared in the fossil record. The way mass extinctions and mass radiations play out doesn&rsquo;t match with each, and they aren&rsquo;t even related to each other. And that tells us something fundamental about the shape of life on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturalists of old envisioned the history of life as the story of progress, of life becoming more advanced and complex through the ages in a way that upholds humanity as the highest form of life. Those notions were replaced by a vision of ecosystems that do not have a preordained direction but are always building up to similar layers of complexity, just as a forest might go through multiple stages before reaching a &lsquo;climax community&rsquo; of many interacting species. It&rsquo;s a view that sees life through time almost as a glass that is filled, drained, and filled to a similar level again, reaching a particular point where ecosystems seem more or less stable with a full complement of producers, herbivores, carnivores, omnivores, scavengers and so on, taking up the available ecological space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the new results reveal that life is not constantly striving to reinvent the same relationships or reach the same waterline time and again. Sometimes, due to an environmental shift or the origin of an evolutionary novelty such as eyesight, species rapidly diversify in response. Other times, ecological shifts quickly and dramatically cut back many species almost in the same instant, but without any promise that the previous order of life will be replayed or restored. The shape of life&rsquo;s diversity is far more varied and responsive than we previously understood, with evolution&rsquo;s greatest radiations usually having little to do with mass extinctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palaeontologists have already begun accumulating evidence for this new view of life&rsquo;s rhythm through Deep Time. The change even touches upon our own prehistory and how our present Age of Mammals rose out of the wreck of the Cretaceous world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Age of Reptiles, the traditional story goes, mammals were small, insect-snatching creatures that lived in fear of the great saurians. Mammals thrived only when the asteroid struck at the end of the Cretaceous, decimating the dinosaurs. But multiple studies have underscored how this story isn&rsquo;t true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prehistoric relatives of ours called mammaliaformes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06277&quot;&gt;pioneered&lt;/a&gt; niches similar to those of raccoons, otters, flying squirrels, anteaters and other beasts familiar to us today. They were so successful that they temporarily shouldered out our more direct mammalian relations. In short, the complexity of mammal diversity had a greater effect on our evolutionary pedigree than the presence or absence of &lt;i&gt;T rex&lt;/i&gt; and company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portraying the evolutionary burst our mammalian kin underwent as dinosaurs merely ceding the stage no longer holds up. It was not simply the absence of the dinosaurs that made the difference. If anything, the formative millennia of mammalian evolution owe a greater debt to other ecological changes that occurred in the postimpact world. While conifers, ferns, cycads, horsetails and similar plants were extremely common during the Age of Reptiles, angiosperms &ndash; or flowering plants &ndash; became far more prominent in the early days of the Age of Mammals. A world warmed by greenhouse gases allowed these new forests to flourish, and a lack of large animals allowed them to grow thick into multitiered environments where the species in the canopy might be very different from those on the forest floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of that, the palaeontologist Meng Chen and colleagues have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/116/20/9931.short&quot;&gt;observed&lt;/a&gt;, many of the mammal lineages that survived the effects of the asteroid strike had a multipurpose molar shape that gave them a literal edge in adapting to new foods &ndash; be it fruits and leaves, insects and even other mammals. Competition for resources likely led to what ecologists call niche partitioning &ndash; or animals adapting to rely on different resources and ways of life in the same habitat &ndash; and spurred the diversity of the mammals. It wasn&rsquo;t as if mammalian evolution had some fuse that was just ready to trigger their evolutionary moment. Rather, conditions changed, providing untold opportunities for varieties of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The particulars of our choices may alter life&rsquo;s history for far longer than we&rsquo;d otherwise expect&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&rsquo;s no single happenstance or evolutionary force that sparks these bursts. There&rsquo;s no rhythm to the pattern. It&rsquo;s not as if prehistoric climate or sea level, some other factor creates just the right conditions. The secret to life&rsquo;s greatest blooms lies in the way organisms affect each other as they adapt and evolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider the Cambrian Explosion, a time between 541 million and 531 million years ago when animal life rapidly evolved into forms so confounding that it can take palaeontologists decades to figure out what sort of creature a given Cambrian animal is. The metre-long predator &lt;i&gt;Anomalocaris&lt;/i&gt; &ndash; with its compound eyes, grasping appendages, and shutter-like mouth &ndash; initially and mistakenly had its various body parts described as different species. Only when a relatively complete specimen turned up did palaeontologists realise that all these pieces went together. The undersea velvet worm &lt;i&gt;Hallucigenia&lt;/i&gt; is yet another example, an animal so unfamiliar that it was originally envisioned as walking on the long spikes sticking out of its tubular body &ndash; a position experts later realised was upside down. These creatures &ndash; and many, many more &ndash; were part of an unprecedented evolutionary burst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no mass extinction that set up the Cambrian Explosion. Instead, life seems to have crossed some sort of threshold &ndash; just as animals did during the Carboniferous when they came onto land. In the case of the Cambrian, it&rsquo;s likely that the origin of eyesight had a major role to play in the arrival of many new species. Whereas some of the earliest animals might have been able to perceive only light and dark &ndash; tracking days and nights, or the shadow of a predator moving overhead &ndash; by the Cambrian, animals were evolving increasingly complex compound eyes. Predators became more adept at capturing prey. Prey became more attuned to the movements of species that might snack on them. Vision that was more precise kicked off an evolutionary push-and-pull that helped spur the origin of new defences, new ways to catch prey, and other shifts that underwrote the burst of Cambrian species. It&rsquo;s from these changes, when life crosses some environmental or anatomical threshold, that organisms evolve in startling new ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life&rsquo;s behaviour in the past can give us a hint about what&rsquo;s to come. We are presently going through what some ecologists have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1400253&quot;&gt;deemed&lt;/a&gt; a sixth mass extinction, a time when we&rsquo;re losing species faster than new ones are evolving. Under the old view, we might expect that whatever species manage to survive humanity&rsquo;s alterations to the planet will rapidly bounce back in a profusion of new forms. The pressure of extinction would be released into a new biodiversity high. But the emerging picture doesn&rsquo;t track with such an expectation. The particulars of our choices may alter life&rsquo;s history for far longer than we&rsquo;d otherwise expect. Life might not recover in a million years&rsquo; time. Instead, whatever biodiversity peak life reaches may rely on the accidental nature of evolution itself. Whatever species survive humanity&rsquo;s presence will proliferate, interact in new ways, and usher in inconceivable ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether applied to our mammalian forebears or some of the first animals of 541 million years ago, life&rsquo;s diversity isn&rsquo;t reliant on mass extinctions for evolutionary inspiration. Life comes roaring forth when species begin to transcend a boundary &ndash; such as plants beginning to grow on land &ndash; or when interactions between species nudge biodiversity into new niches, as was the case with beasts in the heyday of the dinosaurs. Instead of moving to a steady beat, punctuated by relatively few record scratches, life&rsquo;s tempo is full of unexpected and asymmetrical time changes, a cacophonous riot of life.&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2021-12-15 21:47:16', 63, 3739),

But Arcane, the Netflix animated series based on Riot\'s uber-popular MOBA can hit unexpectedly hard. Acting as a kind of origin story for some of League\'s most iconic champions, it\'s much more down to earth and melancholy than you might expect. And that\'s what makes its first episode so damn good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first scene doesn\'t waste any time setting the tone. On a bridge extending between the scientific utopia of Piltover and Zaun, its wasteland underbelly, two orphans wander through the smokey remains of a battle looking for their parents. Hours earlier, it seems, residents of Zaun tried to storm the gates into Piltover and were met with the unbridled fury of Piltover\'s storm-trooper-esque Enforcers. Among the carnage, we see a much younger version of League champs Vi and Powder (who later becomes Jinx), as Vi leads her sister by the hand while she covers her eyes and sings a lullaby to ward off the horrors that surround them. Through the smog, they see a giant of a man beating the shit out of someone. It\'s someone they obviously know, given how Vi&mdash;with a mere look&mdash;seems to ask if he\'s seen their parents. With a frown, the man turns his head and, following his gaze, the two glimpse the corpses of their mother and father in the rubble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s a heart-wrenching moment, as Vi falls to her knees crying while Powder cuddles in next to her. The man, taking pity on the two orphans, drops his massive iron knuckles and carries the kids away from the massacre. A vengeful look fills Vi\'s eyes as she stares at the remaining Enforcers and, beyond them, the gleaming cityscape of Piltover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Arcane Episode 1 Recap&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zwc5guc3BKAAx2eHMAUXRb-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zwc5guc3BKAAx2eHMAUXRb-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zwc5guc3BKAAx2eHMAUXRb-970-80.jpg 970w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: Riot Games)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Welcome to The Lanes&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a stylish title sequence set to Enemy, a song Imagine Dragons wrote specifically for Arcane, we cut forward an indeterminate amount of time. Vi, Powder, and two of their fellow orphans have snuck onto the rooftops of Piltover, and marvel at the massive city and its advanced technology, like floating airships. It\'s an evocative establishing shot that really showcases Arcane\'s gorgeous, hand-painted approach to 3D animation. &quot;One day I\'m going to fly one of those things,&quot; Powder says whimsically.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It immediately becomes clear that the four street rats aren\'t here as tourists, though. And after a dangerous bit of acrobatics to cross from one set of rooftops to another&mdash;where Vi reinforces her big sister image by saving Powder from falling at the last second&mdash;the crew continues to their mysterious destination. Not everyone is onboard with the plan, though, and Vi\'s two friends Milo and Claggor worry that someone named Vander will &quot;kill them&quot; for what they\'re about to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Only if we screw up,&quot; Vi says. &quot;So don\'t screw up.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dropping onto the balcony, we discover the crew\'s target: a science lab full of strange and expensive equipment. Vi, Powder, Milo, and Claggor waste no time pocketing anything and everything they can find. In a separate room, Powder stumbles upon a mysterious chest containing glowing blue nuggets of crystal, brimming with energy. Before she can investigate further, though, Vi hears the sound of footsteps in the hall. Someone is coming. Milo smartly jams the door with a chair as the crew scrambles to grab what they can, but in her haste to pocket all of the crystals Powder drops one.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they flee onto the balcony to make their escape, the blue crystal rolls across the stone floor&mdash;each bounce releasing increasingly violent arcs of magical electricity. Just as Vi grabs her bag to meet everyone outside, the crystal shatters and explodes, obliterating the lab and nearly killing the orphans. Just then, part of the balcony they\'re on collapses onto the street below, nearly killing a patrol of Enforcers. As Vi stares down at the Enforcers, they lock eyes. &quot;Shit,&quot; she says as warning sirens begin to blare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Arcane Episode 1 Recap&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XRS86RgZSoBr9A3YraK4tb-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XRS86RgZSoBr9A3YraK4tb-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XRS86RgZSoBr9A3YraK4tb-970-80.jpg 970w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: Riot Games)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their cover blown, the crew makes a break for it through the streets of Piltover, weaving in and out of rich aristocrats while Enforcers tail them. Vi and everyone runs across the same bridge where, years earlier, her and Powder found their dead parents. On the other side, they dart into a series of alleys and manage to lose their pursuers before riding a slime-filled pipe to safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What the hell was that,&quot; asks Claggor, and it\'s here we get another glimpse of the dynamic of these four orphans. While Vi is undeniably their leader, Powder is the runt tagalong that Milo and Claggor seem to think is bad luck. She\'s too young and helpless to roll with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving through the desiccated streets that separate Piltover and the underground of Zaun, the crew is challenged by another street rat named Deckard who heard about the commotion across the bridge and suspects they\'ve stolen a small fortune. Attempts to diffuse the situation fail, and the kids are drawn into a surprisingly vicious street fight. All except Powder, who watches on the sidelines, clutching a backpack full of stolen goods. One of the attackers notices Powder, and she takes off running with him in pursuit while the rest are too distracted by the scrap. The fight ends with Deckard desperately drawing a knife, to which Vi calls his bluff like a total badass. Drawing in close, so the blade is mere inches from her eye, she stares Deckard down. &quot;Wanna see how that ends?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile Powder flees through the streets and is cornered on a riverbank by the one remaining thug. She pulls out a homemade grenade she calls Mouzer and throws it at him, but all it does is fizzle and release harmless pink smoke. Back against the water, Powder throws their backpack of loot into the water and uses the distraction to make her escape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Undercity blues&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once everyone is reunited just before nightfall, Milo chastises Powder for once again screwing up and ruining all their hard work. Vi steps in to defend her and reassure her that it\'s all okay. But Milo isn\'t having it. As the group boards an elevator down into the true undercity of Zaun, Milo pushes the issue: &quot;Every time she comes something goes wrong. She jinxes every job.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s here that we get our first look at the city that the four orphans call home: A sinister green vertical sprawl of ramshackle buildings jutting out from either side of a narrow canyon. Zaun. It\'s a grimy, neon drenched metropolis lined with brothels, shady back alleys, and merchants selling illicit goods. And it\'s here that we find out that Vander is, in fact, the man from the intro who took Vi and Powder home after their parents were killed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Arcane Episode 1 Recap&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CkxExUn8GYZMsCFY9ZEppc-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CkxExUn8GYZMsCFY9ZEppc-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CkxExUn8GYZMsCFY9ZEppc-970-80.jpg 970w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: Riot Games)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vander isn\'t just a giant, Australian-accented adoptive father, though. He\'s the &quot;Hound of the Underground&quot; and owner of the popular watering hole, The Last Drop. You could say he\'s a bit of a local hero, which is made obvious when Vander intercedes on behalf of a merchant being extorted by two villains. I\'m immediately in love with Vander\'s roguish dad vibe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Vi and crew slip into The Last Drop\'s back room, Vander spots them and knows something is up. Following after them, he immediately sees through their feeble attempt to feign ignorance about the enormous ruckus they caused topside with the explosion. &quot;What the hell were you thinking?&quot; Vander says, and I\'m a little surprised Vi doesn\'t shout back &quot;We learned it from you, dad!&quot; because that\'s clearly what\'s happening here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Vander and Vi argue, it helps establish the dynamics of not only their relationship, but the violence looming over Piltover and Zaun. Vander, keen to help these orphans become self-sufficient, is horrified to see them mimic the very types of crimes that made him a legend in Zaun. More importantly, he\'s upset that Vi doesn\'t seem to understand what kind of responsibility she has being the de facto leader of the group. Meanwhile, Vi doesn\'t see why Piltover should be off limits when everyone there is living a life of luxury while Zaunites are condemned to the gutters. &quot;We make ourselves a problem for Piltover, and they &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; send the Enforcers,&quot; Vander warns. But Vi, being younger and full of spunk, welcomes that threat of violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bigger issues aside, what matters now is that, thanks to Powder throwing the backpack overboard, nothing can tie the kids to what happened in Piltover. Still, Vander will need to smooth the situation over&mdash;starting by having a chat with the informant called &quot;Little Man&quot; who tipped Vi off to the science lab in the first place. He\'s equally concerned about Deckard, the street rat who seemed to know what Vi and everyone were up to. As Vander heads out into Zaun with Claggor, we see Powder fishing around in some trash looking for metal scraps to make another grenade. She opens her small side bag and reveals she kept one of the magical crystals that caused the explosion above. Zoinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heading back inside The Last Drop, Powder overhears Milo and Vi arguing about her. Again. Only this time, the snippet of conversation she catches makes it seem like Vi is agreeing with Milo when she was really standing up for her. Hurt and ashamed, she flees to her room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vander, meanwhile, makes a visit to a close friend and local merchant named Benzo. The two talk about the kids and Vander\'s vain desire to protect them from the harsh reality of the world they inhabit. Vander mentions Deckard and how troubling he finds it that he seemingly knew about the heist and hints that there\'s much worse things in the world than Enforcers. Outside, Claggor questions Little Man&mdash;who turns about to be a much younger Echo, another League champion&mdash;about how he learned about the science lab. Just as they\'re talking, two Enforcers show up and Claggor flees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Arcane Episode 1 Recap&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sW2KRPuXwFV8Beb3tgBpab-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sW2KRPuXwFV8Beb3tgBpab-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sW2KRPuXwFV8Beb3tgBpab-970-80.jpg 970w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: Riot Games)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s clear right away that Vander has a special relationship with one of these Enforcers, an older woman with a gravelly voice named Grayson. The two, it seems, have an uneasy alliance to try and keep the peace between Piltover and Zaun. But that peace is now threatened by today\'s events. Turns out the lab was owned by a powerful Piltover family and Piltover\'s ruling government, the Council, is demanding someone\'s head. Unless Vander gives her a name, she can\'t guarantee it won\'t lead to Piltover cops shoving their way into Zaun. Vander, being the absolute unit that he is, refuses to snitch, but Grayson leaves him with a communication device he can use to reach her if he changes his mind. Meanwhile, Echo had been eavesdropping on the whole exchange and is obviously troubled to see Vander cavorting with cops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back at The Last Drop, Vi finds Powder drawing a cute face on another grenade&mdash;a kind of calling card for the hero\'s makeshift (but haphazard) weapons in the game. Vi tries to console Powder, who is upset about letting the group down again, but it doesn\'t work so Vi takes her topside to show her something. Sitting on the roof of a building in one of the districts straddled between Piltover and Zaun, Vi shares old stories about Claggor and Milo. She also shows her a stuffed bunny that Vi used to love, which bullies threw over some electrical wires crossing the street, putting it forever out of reach. Vi explains that she used to come up there and stare at it, hoping one day a gust of wind might knock the bunny loose so she can reclaim it. The two make amends just as Powder reveals that she held onto not one but &lt;i&gt;several&lt;/i&gt; of the magical crystals from the lab. &quot;Should we tell Vander?&quot; She asks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;No. Let\'s keep this our little secret,&quot; Vi says as the camera pans out to reveal Piltover bathed in the light of the moon. &quot;Milo is wrong, Powder. You\'re stronger than you think. And one day this city is going to respect us.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just before credits roll, we\'re taken to what appears to be some kind of underwater lab. Deckard sits in a chair, flanked by massive tattooed gangsters. He\'s clearly in trouble. In the darkness of the lab, a thin man with facial scars and a single, black eye questions why Deckard disobeyed when his orders were merely to follow Vi&mdash;not fight her. Deckard, scrambling to save his hide, reveals that Vi was responsible for the explosion topside and that Enforcers are looking for them. &quot;Vander\'s in trouble?&quot; the mysterious man says and congratulates Deckard for being useful and sends him and the gangsters away. Now alone, he turns to a gaunt scientist in the corner of the lab handling a glowing pink substance and tells him their timeline has moved forward.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s clear that whatever they\'re up to, this mysterious liquid is a critical ingredient&mdash;and it\'s not long before we have some idea of what it does. As the scientist places a cat in a cage with a helpless mouse, he goads the rodent into drinking from a tube containing the liquid. Almost instantly, the mouse is transformed offscreen into some kind of abomination that slaughters the cat, spraying its blood across the glass panels of the cage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Do you have a subject in mind?&quot; the scientist asks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as the camera settles on the chair Deckard was just sitting in, the man with the black eye responds, &quot;Someone just volunteered.&quot; Cue credits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that\'s the first episode of Arcane! It\'s a killer opener&mdash;one that does a remarkably good job of introducing you to a world as complex as League of Legends. But what I really love is how much emphasis there is on interpersonal drama between Vi, Vander, and the rest of the orphans.

Steven Messner even went so far as to call it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/arcane-episode-1-recap/&quot;&gt;&quot;stunning.&quot;&lt;/a&gt; Such plaudits have gone alongside popular success, with the show currently the second most-watched on Netflix after Squid Game: Which it even briefly dethroned for a few days, per &lt;a href=&quot;https://flixpatrol.com/top10/netflix/world/2021-11-10/&quot;&gt;stats-tracking site Flixpatrol&lt;/a&gt; (this site calculates its stats based on Netflix\'s own daily top 10s).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the funny things about all of this is, of course, is that it\'s pretty easy to watch a Netflix series, but should you wish to explore further... League of Legends is not the most welcoming game around. Nevertheless, the show\'s success has coincided with an unmistakable uptick in the number of players choosing key characters from the show (thanks, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nme.com/news/gaming-news/arcane-causes-pick-rates-for-jayce-and-jinx-to-soar-in-league-of-legends-3095592&quot;&gt;NME&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The show made its debut on November 6 and Jinx\'s picks saw a steady uptick beforehand, but Jinx has always been a popular character anyway: she went from 11.8% on November 6 to 17.5% at the time of writing, &lt;a href=&quot;https://lolalytics.com/&quot;&gt;per LoLalytics&lt;/a&gt;. Jayce on the other hand soared from a 3.7% pick rate on 6 November to a peak of 12% on 11 November, before settling in at around 8%&mdash;more than double the number of players since the show\'s debut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Vi pick rate and win rate stats in League of Legends.&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w8cwNqspygG89u7NwuyxyT-320-80.png 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w8cwNqspygG89u7NwuyxyT-650-80.png 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w8cwNqspygG89u7NwuyxyT-970-80.png 970w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: Lolalytics)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The show features several LoL characters, but Jinx\'s buddy Vi seems to be the biggest beneficiary of all: her pick rate soared from around 6% on November 6 to a whopping 20.4% at the time of writing. Amusingly enough, you can see the win rate drop over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be quite amusing if Riot ends up tweaking any of these characters in response to their increased popularity, with Jayce\'s winrate in particular consistently hovering in mid-40% range. One thing that\'s doubtless helped with the crossover appeal is that Riot\'s been holding celebrations across all of its games to coincide with Arcane\'s launch, including LoL, doling out things like character skins for the above that bring them more in-line with their appearance in the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should you play League of Legends if you like Arcane? Erm... maybe. Here\'s a comprehensive breakdown of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/arcane-should-I-play-league-of-legends/&quot;&gt;Riot\'s LoL-based games, and which ones might be right for Arcane fans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2021-12-15 21:08:56', 366, 26262);

Others have called roads &lsquo;the single most destructive element in the process of habitat fragmentation&rsquo;, declaring that &lsquo;Few forces have been more influential in modifying the Earth than transportation.&rsquo; Yet you probably didn&rsquo;t even notice. An expansive feature that snaps the globe but is effectively invisible: the vast network of transportation infrastructure &ndash; all the railways, canals but also, most significantly, roads. Roads are everywhere, forming an almost inconceivably complex system, an endless, ever-expanding, interconnected grid that facilitates the movement and exchange of people and goods over vast areas. This colossal structure is probably the greatest ever cultural artefact, a requirement and precondition for human development. For us, roads are essential connectors, linking places and purpose. But almost everywhere these networks have been imposed with scant regard for the landscape in which they occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its extraordinary scale, this vast, inescapable, indispensable network is largely ignored. As we hurtle between the places where we live, shop, learn and play, the road on which we travel is unlikely to cross our minds. (The traffic we encounter is, of course, another matter.) We are even less likely to conceive of the road on which we are travelling as a component of the huge, sprawling web made up of all the roads spreading out over regions and the entire continent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we conceive of a road at all, it is most likely as a trip taking the shortest distance from A to B as displayed by a map app on a smartphone. Much harder to envision is the network of interconnected roads, a literal web, sometimes densely meshed in places where many people live, sometimes in diffuse bands that skirt around areas of difficult terrain where human presence is low. It is not only the most efficient connection for people we should consider, of course, but also the resulting subdivision of the landscape into pieces &ndash; fragments &ndash; of land bounded on all sides by roads. These pieces may be city blocks, farms or national parks but they are all, to some extent, circumscribed by the surrounding roads and the traffic these carry. Unsurprisingly, there are strong and obvious relationships between the density of humans and the density of roads. This is most evident in small countries with large populations. The Netherlands, for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art39/&quot;&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt;, compact and crowded, has a road density of 1.55 km (0.96 miles) of road per square kilometre. However, even in a country as apparently spacious as the continental United States, there is almost nowhere more than a few miles from a paved road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why might this matter? Imagine any large animal, a deer or wolf perhaps, that needs to travel for any typical but compelling reason: finding food, seeking a mate, regular migration. Wherever it lives, wherever it moves, sooner or later it will come upon a road. What happens next will depend on a lot of different factors. It may travel this route regularly and be quite familiar with the abrupt change in the landscape. Or it may have never encountered a road before. It may even be attracted to the roadside to graze on the grass, sample the edible trash or scavenge the dead animals found alongside. On the other hand, the noise or lights of the traffic may be so disturbing that the animal retreats as far away as possible. The animal may cross if there are no vehicles, or inexplicably wander straight into the traffic. It may be sufficiently motivated to cross despite the risk or, having learned to judge what are safe intervals between moving vehicles, it may delay crossing until the quietest parts of the night. All of these responses are happening almost everywhere every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crossing a road with traffic is often dangerous for wildlife, especially for slower, ground-dwellers. Collisions with vehicles almost always lead to the death or serious injury of the animal, and the numbers involved are almost unbelievable. For example, about a million individuals of all species are killed every day on the roads of the US. In North America overall, the cumulative scale of all this roadkill now surpasses hunting as the main cause of death in larger species. It is now &lt;a href=&quot;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347216301294&quot;&gt;regarded&lt;/a&gt; by researchers as an &lsquo;evolutionary novel threat&rsquo;. While some types of mammals such as deer (being much more conspicuous) dominate the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0966692306001177&quot;&gt;statistics&lt;/a&gt;, the numbers of smaller, less obvious groups such as birds and amphibians are enormous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, not every road is dangerous. Some have very little traffic or virtually none at night. Certain species have learned to avoid vehicles and cross when it is safe. And even shockingly large roadkill tolls do not mean that a species or local population is imperilled. Having a lot of visible roadkill may simply indicate that the species is plentiful in the area. Certainly, the enormous number of white-tailed deer in North America or roe deer in Europe killed through collisions with vehicles has had a negligible impact on their abundance. There is, however, powerful evidence that collisions with vehicles can drive species to the point of extinction. Infamously, during the 1980s, around 10 per cent of the entire Florida panther population of was killed annually. In Tasmania, a simple road upgrade &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1071/WR98069&quot;&gt;led&lt;/a&gt; to the elimination of a rare marsupial carnivore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the sight of dead animals along the roadside is troubling, other influences may be far more important. For many species, it is not the traffic that is the problem: it is the road and the associated space that matters. In extreme cases, some animals &ndash; small forest-dwelling birds or rodents, for example &ndash; simply will not cross even a small road, whether cars are present or not. For these species, the gap may be a complete barrier to their movement. This so-called &lsquo;barrier effect&rsquo; is one the most significant discoveries made recently by scientists studying roads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These insights have added a new and alarming dimension to our understanding of the way habitat destruction impacts biodiversity. The cumulative effect is that, piece by piece, what was once a continuous natural landscape has been relentlessly subdivided and separated into increasingly smaller patches. At its most pronounced, the resulting landscape &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1008036602639&quot;&gt;becomes&lt;/a&gt; a series of discrete islands, each isolated from one another by the surrounding &lsquo;sea&rsquo; of entirely different, often hostile, environments.&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2021-12-15 21:46:15', 366, 3636),

This decades-spanning fable of power and corruption turns out to be something much less clear-cut than the familiar David-and-Goliath tale of a sociopathic corporation and the lives it steamrolls. Through the eyes of Kosawa&rsquo;s citizens young and old, Mbue constructs a nuanced exploration of self-interest, of what it means to want in the age of capitalism and colonialism &mdash; these machines of malicious, insatiable wanting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Random House. $28. | &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/08/books/review/imbolo-mbue-how-beautiful-we-were.html&quot;&gt;Read our review&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/19/books/imbolo-mbue-how-beautiful-we-were.html&quot;&gt;Read our profile of Mbue&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/12/books/review/podcast-imbolo-mbue-how-beautiful-we-were-annalee-newitz-four-lost-cities.html&quot;&gt;Listen to Mbue on the podcast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Intimacies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Katie Kitamura&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Kitamura&rsquo;s fourth novel, an unnamed court translator in The Hague is tasked with intimately vanishing into the voices and stories of war criminals whom she alone can communicate with; falling meanwhile into a tumultuous entanglement with a man whose marriage may or may not be over for good. Kitamura&rsquo;s sleek and spare prose elegantly breaks grammatical convention, mirroring the book&rsquo;s concern with the bleeding lines between intimacies &mdash; especially between the sincere and the coercive. Like her previous novel, &ldquo;A Separation,&rdquo; &ldquo;Intimacies&rdquo; scrutinizes the knowability of those around us, not as an end in itself but as a lens on grand social issues from gentrification to colonialism to feminism.

It cuts back and forth between the tale of Ailey Pearl Garfield, a Black girl growing up at the end of the 20th century, and the &ldquo;songs&rdquo; of her ancestors, Native Americans and enslaved African Americans who lived through the formation of the United States. As their stories converge, &ldquo;Love Songs&rdquo; creates an unforgettable portrait of Black life that reveals how the past still reverberates today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harper/HarperCollins. $28.99. | &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/24/books/review/the-love-songs-of-web-du-bois-honoree-fanonne-jeffers.html&quot;&gt;Read our review&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/01/books/review/podcast-richard-powers-bewilderment-honoree-fanonne-jeffers-love-songs-web-du-bois.html&quot;&gt;Listen to Jeffers on the podcast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;No One Is Talking About This&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Patricia Lockwood&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lockwood first found acclaim as a poet on the internet, with gloriously inventive and ribald verse &mdash; sexts elevated to virtuosity. In &ldquo;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/09/books/review/priestdaddy-patricia-lockwood-memoir.html&quot;&gt;Priestdaddy&lt;/a&gt;,&rdquo; her indelible 2017 memoir about growing up in rectories across the Midwest presided over by her gun-loving, guitar-playing father, a Catholic priest, she called tweeting &ldquo;an art form, like sculpture, or honking the national anthem under your armpit.&rdquo; Here, in her first novel, she distills the pleasures and deprivations of life split between online and flesh-and-blood interactions, transfiguring the dissonance into art. The result is a book that reads like a prose poem, at once sublime, profane, intimate, philosophical, hilarious and, eventually, deeply moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riverhead Books. $25. | &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/16/books/review/no-one-is-talking-about-this-patricia-lockwood.html&quot;&gt;Read our review&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/books/patricia-lockwood-no-one-is-talking-about-this.html&quot;&gt;Read our profile of Lockwood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When We Cease to Understand the World&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Benjam&iacute;n Labatut. Translated by Adrian Nathan West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labatut expertly stitches together the stories of the 20th century&rsquo;s greatest thinkers to explore both the ecstasy and agony of scientific breakthroughs: their immense gains for society as well as their steep human costs. His journey to the outermost edges of knowledge &mdash; guided by the mathematician &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/16/world/europe/alexander-grothendieck-math-enigma-dies-at-86.html&quot;&gt;Alexander Grothendieck&lt;/a&gt;, the physicist &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/14/books/how-uncertain-was-he.html&quot;&gt;Werner Heisenberg&lt;/a&gt; and the chemist &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1934/02/02/archives/fritz-haber-dead-noted-as-chemist-chief-technical-adviser-of.html&quot;&gt;Fritz Haber&lt;/a&gt;, among others &mdash; offers glimpses of a universe with limitless potential underlying the observable world, a &ldquo;dark nucleus at the heart of things&rdquo; that some of its witnesses decide is better left alone. This extraordinary hybrid of fiction and nonfiction also provokes the &lt;i&gt;frisson&lt;/i&gt; of an extended true-or-false test: The further we read, the blurrier the line gets between fact and fabulism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York Review Books.

Along with everyone else in our course, we spent six long years memorising everything that could go wrong with the human body. We diligently worked our way through a textbook called &lt;i&gt;Pathologic Basis of Disease&lt;/i&gt; that described, in detail, every single ailment that could befall a human being. It&rsquo;s no wonder medical students become hypochondriacal, attributing sinister causes to any lump, bump or rash they find on their own person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jason&rsquo;s oft-repeated observation reminded me that death (and disease) are unavoidable aspects of life. It sometimes seems, though, that we&rsquo;ve developed a delusional denial of this in the West. We pour billions into prolonging life with increasingly expensive medical and surgical interventions, most of them employed in our final, decrepit years. From a big-picture perspective, this seems a futile waste of our precious health-dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. If I get struck down with cancer, heart disease or any of the myriad life-threatening ailments I learnt about in medicine, I want all the futile and expensive treatments I can get my hands on. I value my life. In fact, like most humans, I value staying alive above pretty much everything else. But also, like most, I tend to not really value my life unless I&rsquo;m faced with the imminent possibility of it being taken away from me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another old friend of mine, Ross, was studying philosophy while I studied medicine. At the time, he wrote an essay called &lsquo;Death the Teacher&rsquo; that had a profound effect on me. It argued that the best thing we could do to appreciate life was to keep the inevitability of our death always at the forefront of our minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Australian palliative care nurse Bronnie Ware interviewed scores of people in the last 12 weeks of their lives, she asked them their greatest regrets. The most frequent, published in her &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hayhouse.com/the-top-five-regrets-of-the-dying&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;The Top Five Regrets of the Dying&lt;/i&gt; (2011), were:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish I&rsquo;d had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish I hadn&rsquo;t worked so hard;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish I&rsquo;d had the courage to express my feelings;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish that I had let myself be happier.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relationship between death-awareness and leading a fulfilling life was a central concern of the German philosopher Martin Heidegger, whose work inspired Jean-Paul Sartre and other existentialist thinkers. Heidegger lamented that too many people wasted their lives running with the &lsquo;herd&rsquo; rather than being true to themselves. But Heidegger actually struggled to live up to his own ideals; in 1933, he joined the Nazi Party, hoping it would advance his career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite his shortcomings as a man, Heidegger&rsquo;s ideas would go on to influence a wide range of philosophers, artists, theologians and other thinkers. Heidegger believed that Aristotle&rsquo;s notion of Being &ndash; which had run as a thread through Western thinking for more than 2,000 years, and been instrumental in the development of scientific thinking &ndash; was flawed at a most fundamental level. Whereas Aristotle saw all of existence, including human beings, as things we could classify and analyse to increase our understanding of the world, in &lt;i&gt;Being and Time&lt;/i&gt; (1927) Heidegger argued that, before we start classifying Being, we should first ask the question: &lsquo;Who or what is doing all this questioning?&rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heidegger pointed out that we who are asking questions about Being are qualitatively different to the rest of existence: the rocks, oceans, trees, birds and insects that we are asking about. He invented a special word for this Being that asks, looks and cares. He called it &lt;i&gt;Dasein&lt;/i&gt;, which loosely translates as &lsquo;being there&rsquo;. He coined the term &lt;i&gt;Dasein&lt;/i&gt; because he believed that we had become immune to words such as &lsquo;person&rsquo;, &lsquo;human&rsquo; and &lsquo;human being&rsquo;, losing our sense of wonder about our own consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heidegger&rsquo;s philosophy remains attractive to many today who see how science struggles to explain the experience of being a moral, caring person aware that his precious, mysterious, beautiful life will, one day, come to an end. According to Heidegger, this awareness of our own inevitable demise makes us, unlike the rocks and trees, hunger to make our life worthwhile, to give it meaning, purpose and value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Western medical science, which is based on Aristotelian thinking, sees the human body as a material thing that can be understood by examining it and breaking it down to its constituent parts like any other piece of matter, Heidegger&rsquo;s ontology puts human experience at the centre of our understanding of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, I was diagnosed with melanoma. As a doctor, I knew how aggressive and rapidly fatal this cancer could be. Fortunately for me, the surgery seemed to achieve a cure (touch wood). But I was also fortunate in another sense. I became aware, in a way I never had before, that I was going to die &ndash; if not from melanoma, then from something else, eventually. I have been much happier since then. For me, this realisation, this acceptance, this awareness that I am going to die is at least as important to my wellbeing as all the advances of medicine, because it reminds me to live my life to the full every day. I don&rsquo;t want to experience the regret that Ware heard about more than any other, of not living &lsquo;a life true to myself&rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most Eastern philosophical traditions appreciate the importance of death-awareness for a well-lived life. &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Tibetan Book of the Dead&lt;/i&gt;, for example, is a central text of Tibetan culture. The Tibetans spend a lot of time living with death, if that isn&rsquo;t an oxymoron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The East&rsquo;s greatest philosopher, Siddhartha Gautama, also known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aeon.co/essays/was-the-buddha-an-awakened-prince-or-a-humble-itinerant&quot;&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;, realised the importance of keeping the end in sight. He saw desire as the cause of all suffering, and counselled us not to get too attached to worldly pleasures but, rather, to focus on more important things such as loving others, developing equanimity of mind, and staying in the present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last thing the Buddha said to his followers was: &lsquo;Decay is inherent in all component things! Work out your salvation with diligence!&rsquo; As a doctor, I am reminded every day of the fragility of the human body, how closely mortality lurks just around the corner. As a psychiatrist and psychotherapist, however, I am also reminded how empty life can be if we have no sense of meaning or purpose. An awareness of our mortality, of our precious finitude, can, paradoxically, move us to seek &ndash; and, if necessary, create &ndash; the meaning that we so desperately crave.&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2021-12-15 21:12:45', 1889166, 8333287),

The two-and-half-minute track boils over as the melodic Dallas rapper harmonizes, &ldquo;This is why I still be in my feelings,&rdquo; and unfurls what seems like a lifetime of frustrations large and small. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t forgot the pain, I&rsquo;m just working on my forgiveness,&rdquo; he says.

So please don&rsquo;t take yourself too seriously while reading this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Brief History of Pythagoras&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2500 or so years ago, there was a philosopher and mathematician in South Italy named &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras&quot;&gt;Pythagoras&lt;/a&gt;. You may have &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem&quot;&gt;heard of him&lt;/a&gt;, but the story behind the man who studied triangles and math theorems is much wilder than you probably think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pythagoras ran a &lt;a href=&quot;https://classicalwisdom.com/philosophy/cult-of-pythagoras/&quot;&gt;number-worshipping cult&lt;/a&gt;, and his followers were called &lt;i&gt;mathematikoi&lt;/i&gt;. Pythagoras told his followers to pray to numbers, particularly sacred ones like 1, 7, 8, and 10. After all, &ldquo;1&rdquo; is the building block of the entire universe. For some&amp;nbsp;reason, the number &ldquo;10&rdquo; (called the &lt;i&gt;Tetractys&lt;/i&gt;) was the most holy. It was so holy, in fact, they &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=Q5JaCAAAQBAJ&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=bless%20us%2C%20divine%20number&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;made sacrifices to it every time a theorem was discovered&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;Bless us, divine number!&rdquo; they prayed to the number 10. &ldquo;Thou who generated gods and men!&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Pythagoras, the universe cannot exist without numbers, and therefore numbers hold the meaning of life and&amp;nbsp;existence. More specifically, the idea rational numbers built the universe was sacred and unquestionable. Apart from enabling volume, space, and everything physical, rational numbers also enabled art and beauty &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.storyofmathematics.com/greek_pythagoras.html&quot;&gt;especially in music&lt;/a&gt;. So fervent was this sacred belief, legend says Pythagoras &lt;a href=&quot;https://listverse.com/2017/04/26/10-strange-facts-about-pythagoras-mathematician-and-cult-leader/&quot;&gt;drowned a man for proving irrational numbers existed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are Our Thoughts Really Dot Products?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*SaO_sOydo9IlWUDrBS6IQw.jpeg?q=20&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/770/1*SaO_sOydo9IlWUDrBS6IQw.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/304/1*SaO_sOydo9IlWUDrBS6IQw.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/607/1*SaO_sOydo9IlWUDrBS6IQw.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/704/1*SaO_sOydo9IlWUDrBS6IQw.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/770/1*SaO_sOydo9IlWUDrBS6IQw.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot; width=&quot;700&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiplying matrices summons demons,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rfHNvHu8OE&quot;&gt;as alluded by Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today. It may not be obvious to most people, but &ldquo;artificial intelligence&rdquo; is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAioWlhKA90&quot;&gt;nothing more than some math formulas cleverly put together&lt;/a&gt;. Many researchers hope to use such formulas to replicate human intelligence on a machine. Now you may defend this idea and say &ldquo;Cannot a math formula define intelligence, thoughts, behaviors, and emotions?&rdquo; See what you just did there? &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoreanism#Vegetarianism&quot;&gt;No fava beans for you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice how even though we barely have an idea how the brain works especially when it comes to intelligence and consciousness, even the most educated people (scientists, journalists, etc) are quick to suggest an idea without evidence. Perhaps you find mathematics so convincing as a way to explain the world&rsquo;s phenomena, you are &lt;i&gt;almost &lt;/i&gt;certain emotions and intelligence can be modeled mathematically too. Is this not the natural human tendency to react to the unknown with a philosophy or worldview? Perhaps this is the very nature of hypotheses and theories. Before you know it, we sell the neural network model (&lt;i&gt;loosely &lt;/i&gt;inspired by neurons in the brain) as a carbon copy of biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But again, &lt;i&gt;you don&rsquo;t know if this is true&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is every thought, feeling, or even behavior we have really a bunch of numbers being multiplied and added in linear algebra fashion? Are our brains, in fact, simply a neural network doing dot products all day? Reducing our consciousness to a matrix of numbers (or any mathematical model) is certainly Pythagorean. If everything is numbers, then so is our consciousness. Perhaps this is why so many scientists believe general artificial intelligence is possible, as being human is no different than being a computer.&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.yahoo.com/deepmind-apos-alphazero-now-showing-190000147.html&quot;&gt; It may also be why people are quick to anthropomorphize chess algorithms.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;21st Century Pythagoreanism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this reason I believe &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoreanism&quot;&gt;Pythagoreanism &lt;/a&gt;is alive and well, and the sensationalism of AI research is rooted in it. You might say &ldquo;Well I get Pythagorean philosophy says that \'everything is numbers\' and by definition that includes our thoughts&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;behaviors. And sure, maybe AI research unknowingly clings to this philosophy. But what about number worship? Are you really going to suggest that happens today?&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hold my beer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Silicon Valley, a former Google/Uber executive started an AI-worshipping church called&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wayofthefuture.church/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Way of the Future&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. According to documents filed with the IRS, the religious nonprofit states its mission is &ldquo;the realization, acceptance, and worship of a Godhead based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) developed through computer hardware and software.&rdquo; You might justifiably say this community exists on the extremes of society, but we cannot dismiss the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/anthony-levandowski-artificial-intelligence-religion/&quot;&gt;high profile people and companies involved and how the church seeks to entrench itself into the scientific community&lt;/a&gt;. Here are some excerpts from their mission statements:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Way of the Future (WOTF) is about creating a peaceful and respectful transition of who is in charge of the planet from people to people + &ldquo;machines&rdquo;. Given that technology will &ldquo;relatively soon&rdquo; be able to surpass human abilities, we want to help educate people about this exciting future and prepare a smooth transition. Help us spread the word that progress shouldn&rsquo;t be feared (or even worse locked up/caged).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright, never mind the fact sensationalism about near-term AI capabilities &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/aygSMgK3BEM&quot;&gt;was alive and kicking in the 1960&rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt;. But let&rsquo;s keep reading:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;We believe that intelligence is not rooted in biology. While biology has evolved one type of intelligence, there is nothing inherently specific about biology that causes intelligence. Eventually, we will be able to recreate it without using biology and its limitations. From there we will be able to scale it to beyond what we can do using (our) biological limits (such as computing frequency, slowness and accuracy of data copy and communication, etc).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, for all this talk about science and objectivity&hellip; there is so much Pythagorean philosophy filling in the gaps. A belief that intelligence is not biological but rather mathematical (because that is what AI is) is hardly proven and yet labels itself as hard science, just like Pythagoras claimed his beliefs were. And how can the uproven claim that &ldquo;intelligence is not rooted in biology&rdquo; stand up to the fact intelligence (even by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intelligence&quot;&gt;a layman&rsquo;s definition&lt;/a&gt;) has only existed in biology? I am not refuting this claim, but darn it we have had a hard and expensive time trying to prove it over the past 60 years, and with no success. At this point, shouldn&rsquo;t we be entertaining opposing theories&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;little&amp;nbsp;more?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I visualize a time when we will be to robots what dogs are to humans, and I&rsquo;m rooting for the machines.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&mdash; Claude Shannon&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless, let&rsquo;s just assume this group is not reflective of the general AI community (How many of you are going to church to worship an AI overlord anyway?) There are still a lot of journalists, researchers, and a general public who may not share these sentiments in a religious sense, but they are&amp;nbsp;still&amp;nbsp;influenced&amp;nbsp;by&amp;nbsp;them. Many people worry robots will take their blue and white collar jobs, or worse create a SkyNet-like takeover of society. Other folks worry we will become cyborgs in a figurative or literal sense and AI will dehumanize humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The question of whether a computer can think is no more interesting than the question of whether a submarine can swim.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&mdash; Edsger Dijkstra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science fiction movies definitely have not helped imaginations stay tempered within reality. But still, Silicon Valley executives and researchers insist this can happen in the near future and continue to promote exaggerated claims about AI capabilities. They could simply be doing this as a publicity stunt to attract media attention and VC funding, but I think many sincerely believe it. Why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;With artificial intelligence we are summoning the demon. In all those stories where there&rsquo;s the guy with the pentagram and the holy water, it&rsquo;s like yeah he&rsquo;s sure he can control the demon. Didn&rsquo;t work out.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&mdash; Elon Musk&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sensationalism, fear, and even worship of artificial intelligence is 21st century Pythagoreanism. In layman&rsquo;s terms, it is completely based on a theory that intelligence, thoughts, and emotions are nothing more than&amp;nbsp;mathematical&amp;nbsp;models. If this theory indeed holds up to be true, then of course a neural network could replicate human intelligence. But is human intelligence really that simple to model? Or should we acknowledge human intelligence is not understood enough&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;make&amp;nbsp;this&amp;nbsp;possible?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pythagoras Says Everything is Numbers. So What?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, everything is numbers in the domain of artificial intelligence and in Pythagorean philosophy. Why does this matter?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not saying Pythagoreanism is wrong, but rather much of the scientific community fails to acknowledge they are driven just as much by a philosophy as they are science. One must be careful when they make scientific claims without acknowledging their own worldviews, because everyone lives by a philosophy whether they realize it or not. Philosophy forces us to reason about our existence, how we react to the unknown, and disclose our own biases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To presume how human intelligence works quickly crosses a fine line. Failing to make this distinction between philosophy and science is going to hurt the reputation of the scientific community. Before millions of dollars are invested and sunk into an AI startup, it might be a good idea to vet out which claims about AI capability are merely philosophical versus absolute. Time and time again, ambitious AI research has a poor track record when it comes to credibility and delivering what they say is possible. I think a lack of philosophical disclosure is largely responsible for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What If Everything Isn&rsquo;t Numbers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if the world is not structured and harmonious but rather messy and chaotic, and we merely use math just to loosely make sense of it? What if consciousness, intelligence, and emotions are not numbers and math functions? What if the human (and even animal) mind is infinitely more complex in ways we cannot model? Humans and animals are after all irrational and chaotic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we do not have discussions to these questions (and do it publicly), we are kidding ourselves when we make assertions about the unknown. And we should not entertain and accept just one philosophy. We should be able to discuss them all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Failing to make this distinction between philosophy and science is going to hurt the reputation of the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do not buy into this philosophy of 21st century Pythagoreanism, then the best you can strive for is have AI &ldquo;simulate&rdquo; actions that give the illusion it has sentiments and thoughts. A translation program does not understand Chinese.&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room&quot;&gt; It &ldquo;simulates&rdquo; the illusion of understanding Chinese by finding probabilistic patterns.&lt;/a&gt; The algorithm does not understand what it is doing, know it is doing it, or much less why it is doing it. In a non-Pythagorean world, AI is like a magician passing off tricks as magic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if we got it all wrong, and it is biology that will always be intelligently superior and it is technology that is limited? We are trying to emulate biology after all, and with great frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&rsquo;s what I believe, and I am not a Luddite saying we shouldn&rsquo;t try to make &ldquo;smarter&rdquo; machines. We need to set out to achieve small, reasonable goals focused on diverse and specific sets of problems&hellip; with equally diverse and specific solutions. In other words, we can accept it is okay to create algorithms that are great at one task, rather than spin our wheels creating an algorithm that does everything (&ldquo;jack of all trades, master of none&rdquo; and all that). If it is not to prevent AI winters, sunk investments, and wasted careers, let&rsquo;s do it to make AI research more pragmatic and less sensationalized. &lt;a href=&quot;https://towardsdatascience.com/is-deep-learning-already-hitting-its-limitations-c81826082ac3&quot;&gt;We have seen enough AI winters to know better by now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;EDIT:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have heard some feedback on this article, many with compelling arguments that suggest I should perhaps clarify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will admit that only suggesting &quot;dot products&quot; as a way to model thoughts is a little reductionist. Really it can be any math model invented or yet to be discovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That being said, this article is not meant to be argumentive but rather rhetorical&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;spark&amp;nbsp;discussion, and comment on the parallels between Pythagorean philosophy and AI sensationalism. There are many philosophical discussions on AI. I just find it problematic they are not discussed in the open with the public and media&amp;nbsp;enough. I am also surprised nobody has ever compared AI sensationalism to Pythagoreanism. If you find this wrong then please say why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is anyone&rsquo;s prerogative to put resources and costs into research that may become a dead end in the name of science, and I wish them success. However, the AI winters and failures of past decades does raise questions if we are doing it all again, and we are not learning from the past. The Pythagorean perception is simply one explanation why strong AI is marketed as a near term possibility, even though we have no models that remotely come close yet. If intelligence is indeed just numbers and functions, then it is just a matter of time before finding the right model.&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2021-12-15 21:12:06', 62622, 141415);

Its iconic bull&rsquo;s eye plan, with concentric circles radiating outward from a single point, coincides perfectly with the central status assumed within the architectural canon by this &lsquo;little temple&rsquo;. Architectural historians often argue that the Tempietto functions as a compelling geometrical metaphor for Leonardo da Vinci&rsquo;s &lsquo;Vitruvian Man&rsquo; (1490) &ndash; his study of the body&rsquo;s proportions &ndash; where both of these designs exalt the human form by placing it firmly at the centre of a perfectly ordered universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d2e1bqvws99ptg.cloudfront.net/user_image_upload/1701/insert-SM_21_4_10_Ardon_Bar_Hama.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet the comparison of these two images encourages us to think of the Tempietto in terms of a disembodied pattern of visual forms, rather than a physical environment built to accommodate dynamic, living human bodies. As the Finnish architect Juhani Pallasmaa has shown in his classic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wiley.com/en-us/The+Eyes+of+the+Skin%3A+Architecture+and+the+Senses%2C+3rd+Edition-p-9781119941286&quot;&gt;manifesto&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;The Eyes of the Skin&lt;/i&gt; (1996), architecture offers an immersive, embodied experience that engages not just the eye but all of our senses simultaneously. Our overwhelming emphasis upon the visual aspects of architectural design fails to acknowledge the fact that, to gain understanding and knowledge of buildings, we rely upon all of our senses, including sight, sound, smell, taste and touch, as well as bodily senses such as proprioception and kinaesthesia, which are associated with balance and movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here I want to reconsider the Tempietto by shifting our attention away from the hypnotising perspective of the eye, to investigate how a complex variety of sensory experiences defined the encounter with the Tempietto for 16th-century visitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tempietto has enjoyed a remarkable afterlife. In his treatise&lt;i&gt; I quattro libri dell&rsquo;architettura &lt;/i&gt;(1570), Andrea Palladio included the Tempietto &ndash; completed in 1502 &ndash; among the greatest monuments of ancient Rome, justifying this choice with the affirmation that its designer, Bramante, &lsquo;was the first to bring to light the good and beautiful architecture that since the time of the ancients until the present had been hidden.&rsquo; For Palladio, the Tempietto matched the greatest works of antiquity, signalling a victorious return to the &lsquo;good and beautiful&rsquo; classical language of architecture forgotten by medieval builders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the Tempietto stands discreetly hidden in the courtyard of the church of San Pietro in Montorio, Bramante put it on the world stage by choosing it as the model for his redesign of St Peter&rsquo;s Basilica, begun in 1506. The massive cupola of St Peter&rsquo;s &ndash; completed a century later &ndash; is a scaled-up Tempietto that still dominates the city of Rome today, a triumphalist symbol of the universal aspirations of the papacy and the Church. Raised high above the urban landscape, its spectacular tiered profile has inspired the design of numerous religious and secular monuments around the world, from St Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral in London to the US Capitol in Washington, DC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet even if we instantly recognise the Tempietto&rsquo;s silhouette, this visual familiarity is not equivalent to the complex experience of occupying and moving through such a structure with our bodies. A building can shape an endless variety of experiences &ndash; not only stimulating the sense of sight, but how and what we hear, smell, taste and touch. When we consider sensory experience as a historically and culturally situated phenomenon, the question becomes even more complex: is it possible to recuperate something of the impressions that this building made upon those who encountered it at the time when it was built?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tempietto is closely associated with the development of linear perspective&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if we assume that, today, we have roughly the same human physiology as those who lived in 16th-century Rome, each of us interprets our experiences through lenses shaped by the time and place in which we live. The Tempietto can be read as a complex physical object designed to stimulate the senses in many different ways, creating a whole host of experiences that may or may not align with our own expectations. By beginning to reconstruct other ways of knowing this architecture, we can begin to recognise how even a visual icon like the Tempietto offers more than just a feast for the eyes, and instead is capable of creating an infinite variety of lived interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do we automatically privilege the sense of sight when we think of the Tempietto? One reason is that the Tempietto is closely associated with the development of linear perspective, and axially constructed views of the structure showing it in strict single-point perspective reinforce the impression that perspectival concerns played a dominant role in its design. The Latin word &lt;i&gt;perspectiva&lt;/i&gt; derives from &lt;i&gt;perspicere&lt;/i&gt;, meaning &lsquo;to see with clarity, to examine, to see through&rsquo;, and was in fact a synonym for optics. Architectural historians tend to view the transparent lucidity of the Tempietto&rsquo;s design &ndash; revealed not only in the elegance of its centralised plan but even in its precise architectural detailing &ndash; as a hallmark of Renaissance architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the overwhelmingly visual characteristics that architectural historians associate with the Tempietto, it is hardly surprising that visual readings of the structure prevail over all others: the history of Renaissance architecture itself encourages us to approach the building in this way. But our insistent visual emphasis also makes it more difficult for us to recognise how we might potentially interact with the Tempietto in other ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was Bramante&rsquo;s Tempietto really meant to be appreciated only with the eyes? Historic sources can help us to recuperate other, more complex understandings of these structures and spaces that our fixation with sight may have led us to overlook. To begin, let us consider an excerpt from Vincenzo Scamozzi&rsquo;s architectural treatise, &lt;i&gt;L&rsquo;idea dell&rsquo;architettura universale&lt;/i&gt; (1615). Scamozzi provides an astonishingly visceral account of the importance of multisensory knowledge for the people who worked on building sites for structures such as the Tempietto. This discussion invites us to consider how builders employed many different ways of discriminating between various kinds of materials &ndash; even to the point of sampling them with their tongues &ndash; as opposed to the more detached, not to say disembodied, interactions that we have with building materials today:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stones are known through the senses: when they are tougher and harder this can be easily detected by the eye: they have lustre, and sometimes the glint of salt crystals; to the ear they make a full and sonorous sound, especially in the larger blocks; in terms of smell they produce an odour of sulphur &hellip; above all when they are struck with toothed hammers, or when they are scraped with an iron blade; in terms of taste some have less quality and flavour than others, such as those that are composed more of water than of earth; and finally, in terms of touch some are denser and heavier than others. Also through our breath we recognise those stones that are harder and denser than the others, as the denser stones immediately reveal the breath&rsquo;s humidity on their surfaces, especially when they are buffed and polished, but the softer stones absorb the breath into themselves due to their porous nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If architectural historians are inclined to privilege the experience of sight in their study of Renaissance buildings, Scamozzi tells us something completely different. On the contrary, he is keenly aware of the ways that building materials engage many different sensory modes. In his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/five-senses-9781474299640/&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;The Five Senses&lt;/i&gt; (2016), the philosopher Michel Serres speculates that all of the senses are ultimately variations on the sense of touch, and I would argue that Scamozzi&rsquo;s passage is permeated by a tactile presence. It is easy to imagine a stoneworker&rsquo;s fist tensed around the handle of a chisel just before striking a chunk of stone, or the way that one&rsquo;s breath briefly warms a cold geological matrix, or even how one might detect a curious mineral flavour by touching one&rsquo;s tongue to a stone surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is easy to imagine him passing his palm appreciatively over the rounded surfaces of its granite columns&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scamozzi invites us to bring the elements of architecture close to us and to investigate them from all angles in order to understand them better, and thus to manipulate them better. Far from a fixed, motionless object perceived through the eyes, Scamozzi insists that builders in the Renaissance knew their building materials, and by extension their buildings, by employing all of their senses, where they acquired this specialised sensory knowledge through ongoing lived experiences on the worksite. This knowledge enabled these builders not only to judge the specific qualities of individual materials, but to imagine various scenarios where these qualities also could be leveraged to their greatest potential. While Scamozzi focused in particular upon stone as the most privileged material of Renaissance architecture, surely Renaissance builders might also judge other materials &ndash; timber, iron, glass, brick, plaster &ndash; based upon a wide-ranging variety of sensory knowledge. According to Scamozzi, mastery of the trade required internalising these specific material properties and characteristics, where these accumulated sensory experiences could become an instinctual way of responding to and thinking about the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does this mean in terms of the ways that the sensory experience of a visitor to the Tempietto in the 16th century might differ from our own? Scamozzi&rsquo;s text revealed the builders&rsquo; specialised material knowledge gained through first-hand exposure to an active construction site, as well as the sensory skills they could then bring to bear upon the building. While few of us today could claim such knowledge or skills, we can see how their experience carefully honed the Renaissance builders&rsquo; sensorium to distinguish precise material qualities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we consider Palladio&rsquo;s specialised training as a mason-turned-architect, we recognise that his earnest praise for Bramante&rsquo;s recovery of the ancient way of building carries special weight. Palladio undoubtedly visited the Tempietto, and although he may not have gone so far as to taste the Tempietto&rsquo;s surfaces, it is easy to imagine him touching the sharp profile of a column base with his fingers or passing his palm appreciatively over the rounded surfaces of its granite columns. The complex variety of experiences that a building creates for us can affect us in many ways, physically and intellectually, as well as both consciously and unconsciously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The centralised plan of the Tempietto commemorates the exact location where the crucifixion of St Peter &ndash; depicted in a painting from 1601 by Caravaggio that&rsquo;s also in Rome, at the Santa Maria del Popolo &ndash; was believed to have occurred. The rigorous geometric clarity and coherence of the Tempietto&rsquo;s design corresponded to the design of an early Christian martyrium, a structure built to mark the burial place of a saint. The building consists of two chapels, an upper chapel under the dome, set above the crypt chapel below, containing the holy site. As architectural historians often note, the concentric circles of Bramante&rsquo;s plan draw our attention inexorably toward the single point at its absolute centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d2e1bqvws99ptg.cloudfront.net/user_image_upload/1686/insert-Crucifixion_of_Saint_Peter-Caravaggio_(c.1600).jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Crucifixion of St Peter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;by Caravaggio (1601). Cerasi Chapel, Santa Maria del Popolo, Rome.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Image courtesy Wikimedia&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By considering the Tempietto&rsquo;s function as a pilgrimage destination, we may begin to recover some of the sensory experiences that the site offered its visitors in the Renaissance. Despite the prominent place of the Tempietto in the history of Renaissance architecture, the building itself did not represent the ultimate destination of those pilgrims who came to visit the site of St Peter&rsquo;s crucifixion. Rather, their primary goal was the ground that lay below the structure, where St Peter&rsquo;s persecutors drove their crucifix into the earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subsequent alterations to the Tempietto have made it harder for us to discern the way that pilgrims originally encountered the site. Today, we can peer through a grille placed in a circular opening in the floor of the upper chapel in the Tempietto, which in turn allows us to see down to the floor of the crypt chapel underneath, where a circular opening to the earth below marks the exact point where the crucifix met the ground. Yet the opening that we look through from the upper chapel was introduced only in 1628, during renovations. Prior to these 17th-century interventions, visitors could not see this central point of the Tempietto&rsquo;s design &ndash; the reason for its existence &ndash; without physically entering the crypt chapel. In fact, the superstructure of the Tempietto above the crypt chapel obstructed access to pilgrims eager to come into contact with this holy ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d2e1bqvws99ptg.cloudfront.net/user_image_upload/1687/insert-Plan-and-elevation-of-the-crypt-of-the-Tempietto-Rome-Gabinetto-Nazionale-delle-Stampe.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plan and elevation of the crypt chapel of the Tempietto, Rome.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Courtesy Jack Freiberg/Gabinetto Nazionale delle Stampe&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, a double-ramp stair at the rear of the Tempietto descends to a sunken landing. From here, another flight of stairs leads down into the crypt chapel. Although metal bars prevent us from entering, the landing offers clear sightlines into the interior space: we can easily see both the circular opening set into the centre of the pavement that marks the location of St Peter&rsquo;s crucifixion and the altar immediately behind it. However, prior to 1628, the only access to the crypt chapel was via a doorway set into the rear wall of the Tempietto, above the landing, at the level of the colonnade. Placed directly opposite the front entrance to the main chapel, this opening still exists today, although it now functions as a clerestory window into the crypt chapel below. Originally, however, visitors passed through this opening to descend a long, straight flight of stairs leading down to the crypt chapel below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pilgrims were spared the dangerous voyage to the Holy Land, and could instead step into a simulacrum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the absence of any other windows, the pilgrims required the use of a lantern or a torch, and descended the stairs into the dark. Their descent was made even more treacherous by the absence of railings to hold on to, to maintain balance as they climbed down. At the same time, we know that the crypt chapel also had significant moisture problems: less than a century after the Tempietto&rsquo;s construction, water infiltration had already caused such extreme erosion that much of the stone revetment covering the walls needed to be replaced. Thus, prior to the restorations of 1628, pilgrims entering the crypt chapel entered a forbidding, dank, slippery abyss. In the effort to improve these conditions, wooden planks were laid down over the crypt floor to absorb some of the moisture. However, the presence of these planks suggests that the pilgrims encountered irregular, if not even precarious, conditions underfoot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To confront St Peter&rsquo;s martyrium, the architecture of the Tempietto compelled pilgrims to make a hazardous physical journey that involved multiple, powerful sensory stimuli. We can imagine the shifting, irregular light of the torches on the slow descent; the smell of smoke and fumes produced by the flickering flames; the echoing sounds of voices and bodies reverberating against the wet masonry surfaces; the cautious shifting of weight from one foot to another as the pilgrims moved cautiously downward, unable to rely upon the use of a handrail to steady themselves, feeling their way with their feet; the penetrating odour of dampness and decay seeping into nostrils and mouths; the cold moisture of subterranean air on the submerged skin. In jarring contrast to the longstanding emphasis by architectural historians on the Tempietto as a luminous visual experience, it seems that senses other than sight would have offered Renaissance pilgrims equally if not even more important sources of information during their journey down into the crypt chapel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning in the 15th century, the Franciscans assumed responsibility for the Tempietto, as part of the monastery of San Pietro in Montorio. The Franciscans&rsquo; imaginative efforts to bring the Christian mysteries to life are well known: not only was St Francis credited with inventing the first nativity scene in the 13th century, but beginning in the 15th century the Franciscans created a series of pilgrimage shrines featuring full-scale three-dimensional dioramas such as the elaborate Sacro Monte at Varallo. By visiting these Sacri Monti, or &lsquo;holy mountains&rsquo;, pilgrims were spared the gruelling and dangerous voyage to the Holy Land, and could instead step into a simulacrum of the sites of the life of Christ. Through the careful creation of these staged scriptural events, the Franciscans sought to impress the biblical narratives on both the minds and the bodies of the pilgrims by transforming the familiar storyline into lived, bodily experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d2e1bqvws99ptg.cloudfront.net/user_image_upload/1685/insert-Luiginter-sacro-monte-20880767078_cdc3e7c644_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of a full-scale diorama at the Sacro Monte at Varallo.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Photo courtesy Luiginter/Flickr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the Franciscans at the Sacri Monti, the Franciscans in charge of the Tempietto likely also found didactic value in creating such intense sensory experiences for pilgrims visiting the site. The oppressive, even claustrophobic atmosphere of the crypt chapel served to heighten the anguish of the experience, forcing the pilgrims to reflect upon St Peter&rsquo;s horrific martyrdom. The sense of relief that they would have felt when they finally emerged from the submerged tomb chamber would have been further enhanced by the calm serenity of the Tempietto&rsquo;s architecture aspiring toward the sky, as a majestic, even joyful anticipation of the ultimate triumph of the Resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renovations transformed what had once been an immersive encounter into a primarily visual experience&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subsequent modification of the crypt chapel into an airy, well-ventilated space had profound implications for our sensory experience of the Tempietto&rsquo;s most sacred centre point. These alterations privilege a more exclusively visual interaction with the site, and reduced the significance of the senses of smell and touch. The new openings improved air circulation, reducing the olfactory encounter with smoke and humidity, and served to direct the gaze of the visitor immediately toward key points of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original single-ramp staircase impinged upon the centre of the crypt, and thus the reconstruction of the stair outside the crypt chapel opened up an unobstructed view of this holy ground (a grate placed over the opening prevented pilgrims from touching the ground itself). Even the design of the double-ramp stair seems to have been conceived to reduce opportunities for physical contact: pilgrims exited the crypt using a different stair from the one by which they&rsquo;d entered, thus diminishing the chance of accidentally brushing against each other as they circulated through the narrow space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, these alterations occurred as St Ignatius of Loyola and other reformers conjured up the power of the senses to reinforce the spiritual belief of the faithful. In his Spiritual Exercises of the 1520s, Ignatius urged his followers not only to see the length and breadth of Hell, but to hear the wailings of the damned, to taste the bitterness of their tears, to smell the smoke and sulphur, and to touch the burning flames. At the Sacro Monte at Varallo, major renovations by Galeazzo Alessi in the 1560s included the construction of new partition walls and screens to prevent visitors from entering the reproductions of the holy sites, thereby transforming what had once been an immersive encounter into a primarily visual experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the original organisation of the Sacro Monte encouraged pilgrims to participate in the events of scripture with their bodies, the new layout prompted them to use their eyes to imagine such interactions. In the same way, the 1628 improvements to the crypt chapel at the Tempietto enhanced visual access to focus upon spiritual devotion rather than lived experience. Such interventions guided sensory interactions with the world into the narrower spectrum of practices approved by the Counter-Reformation Church, eliminating possible distractions and encouraging more decorous forms of devotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the outset of this essay, I noted that historians have long promoted a specific understanding of the Tempietto in conjunction with Leonardo&rsquo;s drawing, where the building&rsquo;s design provides a geometrical metaphor for the exaltation of the human body. But as the art historian Jack Freiberg has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/bramantes-tempietto-the-roman-renaissance-and-the-spanish-crown/D6FF18D53262C69193C75764DAFE4594&quot;&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt;, the consecration of the Tempietto in 1502 marked the 10th anniversary of the conquest of the Nasrid kingdom of Granada, and the first wave of colonisation in the New World, by its patrons Ferdinand and Isabella, the king and queen of Spain. While we have long celebrated the Tempietto as a symbol of the dignity of humanity, the construction of this building coincided with the vigorous expansion of European imperialism and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://online.ucpress.edu/jsah/article-abstract/80/3/258/118709/Constructing-Race-and-Architecture-1400-1800-Part?redirectedFrom=fulltext&quot;&gt;emergence&lt;/a&gt; of modern racist ideologies that we still struggle with today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are accustomed to interpreting the Tempietto in terms of humanist ideals, but the placement of a white male body at the centre of the cosmos in Leonardo&rsquo;s drawing takes on poignant meaning in such a context. If the conventional narrative written by architectural historians about the Tempietto has privileged the sense of sight over the other senses, our emphasis upon humanist ideals has also glossed over the way that this building intersects with the rise of European colonial hegemony. The tectonic shift now underway in &lt;a href=&quot;https://upittpress.org/books/9780822966593/&quot;&gt;response&lt;/a&gt; to the Black Lives Matter movement has transformed our understanding of the study and practice of architectural history itself, reminding us of the essential value of other narratives such as these that are all too easily suppressed or forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What kind of visceral, multisensory reaction might the Tempietto create for the descendants of the enslaved people whose forced labour &ndash; enriching Rome via Spain &ndash; effectively made this &lsquo;little temple&rsquo; possible? The racial reckoning in the study of architectural history converges with the study of architecture and the senses, urging us to consider an expanded range of meanings and experiences that are only now becoming clearer, as part of an architectural history that is still being written.&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2021-12-15 21:21:55', 2, 5115),

We are told that Albert Einstein&rsquo;s theory of relativity, the double helix structure of DNA molecules, and images of colliding particles are beautiful, and that, just like works of art, they evoke in us aesthetic responses. Scientists themselves, like artists, are praised for their creativity, originality and aesthetic sensibility. Einstein, for one, regarded the American physicist Albert Michelson, who with Edward Morley co-designed the experiment to measure the velocity of Earth relative to the ether, as &lsquo;the Artist in Science&rsquo;, claiming that not only did Michelson care for devising a good experiment, he wanted his creations to be beautiful too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what does it mean for an experiment to be beautiful? Let us start with the example of Foucault&rsquo;s pendulum, which allows us to illustrate three important ways in which an experiment can be beautiful. In 1851, the French physicist L&eacute;on Foucault devised a way of demonstrating that Earth rotates on its axis. He hung a heavy metal weight from a long cable fixed to the inside of the dome of the Panth&eacute;on in Paris. When he set this pendulum in motion, it slowly swung back and forth, tracing lines in sand placed beneath it. After some time, it became clear that the traces were not all in one line because of Earth&rsquo;s rotation beneath the pendulum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pendulum was beautiful in an obvious visual sense &ndash; as a kind of kinetic sculpture with an almost mesmeric, slow, back-and-forth movement. Scientific equipment can indeed be beautiful, and often is. Take, for instance, chemical retorts, prisms, microscopes and complicated structures built in laboratories. Museums house beautifully crafted scientific instruments and equipment from the past because we can appreciate their aesthetic features. The phenomena we study in the experimental setup &ndash; such as copper sulphate crystals, rainbows produced by prisms, and the microscopic structure of cells &ndash; can be beautiful too. But what made Foucault&rsquo;s pendulum a beautiful experiment is more than its visual beauty. Far more importantly, it showed the effects of Earth&rsquo;s rotation, something important that hadn&rsquo;t been demonstrated before, and it did this in a clever, imaginative and elegant way. The pendulum itself was beautiful, but the ultimate beauty of the experiment is a combination of its significance and its design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s hard to identify the most beautiful experiment in science, but one of the most beautiful in biology was designed by the American geneticists Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl to discover how DNA replicates. What is it about this experiment that makes it beautiful? To understand this, first let us reflect on what the experiment set out to do. It was performed only a few years after one of the most exciting scientific breakthroughs of the 20th century: the discovery in 1953 of the double helix structure of DNA. With the structure of DNA established, the next question the scientific community needed to address was how DNA replicated. There were already three different hypotheses proposed: 1) conservative replication, according to which each of the two strands of the parent DNA molecule are replicated in the new one; 2) semi-conservative replication, according to which one strand of the parent DNA is conserved in the daughter DNA; and 3) dispersive replication, according to which the parent DNA chains break at intervals, with the parental segments combining with new segments to form the daughter DNA. Meselson and Stahl set out to give an answer to the question of how DNA replicates by designing an experiment that would decisively discriminate between the three proposed hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1958, the two scientists published the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC528642/&quot;&gt;results&lt;/a&gt; of that experiment. What they had done to determine the correct hypothesis on DNA replication was to feed bacteria nutrients containing a heavy nitrogen isotope that gets incorporated into the bacterial molecules through metabolising. They studied the genetic material through the next generations, knowing the rates at which bacteria multiply. Instead of using radioactive labelling of the DNA strands, which was common at the time, they decided to use density, and separated the heavy DNA from the light using density-gradient centrifugation. By studying the ratios of light, heavy and hybrid DNA that they obtained, Meselson and Stahl were able to eliminate the conservative and dispersive replication hypotheses, confirming that DNA in fact replicates semi-conservatively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A further aspect of its aesthetic value is not only what this research taught us but also &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; it did so&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons why this experiment is celebrated in science is because it is an example of an &lt;i&gt;experimentum crucis&lt;/i&gt;, or a &lsquo;crucial experiment&rsquo;. Such experiments are important; they deliver a decisive answer to a question. Usually, an experiment is considered crucial when it confirms a hypothesis among alternative competitors, and thus settles a dispute. It is from this ability to deliver a decisive answer to the question of how DNA replicates that the Meselson-Stahl experiment can be considered to derive its beauty. The results are taken to have been clear and straightforward, to have decisively spoken in favour of one of the contender hypotheses, and to have dismissed the alternatives. In his book &lt;i&gt;Beauty and the Beast&lt;/i&gt; (1999), the German historian of science Ernst Peter Fischer argues that &lsquo;the Meselson-Stahl experiments speak &hellip; for themselves and made all further commentary superfluous&rsquo;. In his &lt;a href=&quot;https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300085402/meselson-stahl-and-replication-dna&quot;&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Meselson, Stahl, and the Replication of DNA&lt;/i&gt; (2001), Frederic Lawrence Holmes further argues that the simplicity and clarity of the result makes this experiment easily presentable even to students, serving as an exemplar experiment for science education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above considerations focus on what the Meselson-Stahl experiment did, the significance of its results, but a further aspect of its aesthetic value is not only what this research taught us but also &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; it did so, and this later consideration concerns its design. The Meselson-Stahl experiment is regarded as having an elegant and apt design that is optimally suited for the purpose it set out to achieve. Following the reasoning behind their experimental setup reveals the ingenious beauty of the design that the scientists created. By making the genetic material initially heavy and then light, Meselson and Stahl could extract and measure its weight through the next generations. It is this idea that makes their design original and elegant, and they used the optimal materials and techniques for the job. As such, their simple experiment integrates innovative and creative thinking, and shows aptness by delivering on what the elegant experiment was designed to do, by conclusively deciding which hypothesis was correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having established that the beauty of experiments lies in the elegance and simplicity of their design, the significance of their results and the creative thinking of their designers, I now want to consider whether these aesthetic ideals have carried over to contemporary experiments in science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a clear asymmetry between experiments of a century ago and experiments today. Past experiments, such as the Meselson-Stahl experiment, often involved a few scientists in a room, relatively cheap equipment, and generally the results could be perceived or established without lengthy interpretative work. Experiments today look rather different. Take, for instance, CERN&rsquo;s experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) near Geneva, which not too long ago made one of the most significant discoveries in the history of particle physics: the detection of the Higgs boson that was predicted by the Standard Model. This experiment involves highly complex machinery (which has its own kind of beauty) and data analysis; it is the result of collaborative work between thousands of scientists; and the very boundary of the experiment transcends the borders of countries. Given their complexity and size, do large-scale experiments fit with previous aesthetic ideals? Have they become aesthetically disvalued, or can they still be praised for their aesthetic features?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is undeniable that such contemporary experiments are highly complex: from the machinery they use to the data they produce, they can overwhelm with their size and setup. However, perhaps there is still scope to assign a similar aesthetic value to them as to experiments from a century ago. It seems to me that, despite the complexity behind large-scale experiments, design and aptness continue to be the subject of aesthetic appreciation, and so is the creativity and originality exhibited in the experiment&rsquo;s design. This is despite the fact that the creativity exhibited in the experimental design is now better ascribed to the collective thinking of the community, rather than necessarily to a specific individual, and the optimality and aptness of the design is concealed beneath the complexity of the experimental setup and the machinery involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appreciation of beauty in science, and in art, is not necessarily immediate to us&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if we could make the argument that similar aesthetic features get praised during different experimental traditions, there is a further difference between experiments from a century ago and those of today that perhaps should force us to reconsider the claim of similarity. The difference concerns the way in which we arrive at experimental results. As mentioned earlier, one of the aspects we can appreciate in the experiments on DNA replication is their immediacy: we can observe the results in a &lsquo;singular historical event&rsquo;, as Holmes noted. Such immediacy was characteristic of many, although certainly not all, early experiments. Let&rsquo;s go back to the experiments that natural philosophers performed with the air pump, which allowed them to study many phenomena with a newly invented instrument that could extract air from a cylinder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the painting &lt;i&gt;An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump&lt;/i&gt; (1768) by Joseph Wright of Derby depicts, one could immediately perceive the effect on the living creature when the air from the cylinder was extracted using the air pump, which in turn generated a variety of responses in the audience, from fascination and awe to terror. Similarly, we can see the rainbow through Isaac Newton&rsquo;s prisms, and we can see the bands of light-, heavy- and intermediate-density genetic material in the Meselson-Stahl experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d2e1bqvws99ptg.cloudfront.net/user_image_upload/1703/insert-An_Experiment_on_a_Bird_in_an_Air_Pump_by_Joseph_Wright_of_Derby,_1768.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1768), by Joseph Wright of Derby.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Courtesy the National Gallery, London&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But is there anything immediate when it comes to detecting particles and forces in a huge particle accelerator such as those detected by the LHC? Is there any sense in which the experimenter perceives the result in a &lsquo;singular historical event&rsquo;? Large-scale experiments often involve lengthy statistical data analysis before the experimental scientists can agree whether the data collection indicates an &lsquo;event&rsquo; and whether the event constitutes a discovery. But this asymmetry between experiments with immediately perceivable results and those whose results involve time-consuming analysis, while noteworthy, is not surprising. It simply shows us that the appreciation of beauty in science, and in art, does not always involve perceptual features, and the aesthetic response is not necessarily immediate to us. After all, while many paintings and sculptures might evoke in us an immediate aesthetic response, this is certainly not necessary, and is certainly not the case when we consider artworks such as novels and concertos. We need some time and work to get through an entire novel or a concerto before we can fully appreciate its beauty and aesthetic significance more generally. Similarly with the results of many, especially very complex, experiments, it is ultimately the appreciation of the interplay between design and the significance of the result that provokes the aesthetic response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, we have seen that design is an integral part of our aesthetic appreciation of experiments, but we also seem to value those experiments that did something important: whose results helped to confirm a theory or to make a discovery. A final point I want to explore is how we can understand the significance of experiments that produce null results &ndash; can such experiments be beautiful too? Both the abovementioned experiments &ndash; the Meselson-Stahl and the Michelson-Morley &ndash; were highly original and elegant in their design. But while the former helped confirm the nature of DNA replication, the latter did not deliver on what it was designed to do: the interferometer never detected ether drift, despite continued attempts. Is the Michelson-Morley experiment then disqualified from being beautiful, because of the null results?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/phc3.12730&quot;&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that our understanding of what qualifies as a successful experiment needs to be much broader than simply its confirmation of a hypothesis or its discovery of a predicted particle. For example, the existence of the ether was once an undisputed assumption, until Michelson and Morley set up their incredibly careful experiment, which showed creativity and imagination in its elegant design. Even though it turned out that there is no such thing as an ether, their null results challenged accepted beliefs at the time and prompted the exploration of a new paradigm. So the Michelson-Morley experiment is beautiful because it offered the most elegant way to achieve its goal: the two scientists exhibited original and creative thinking, inventing one of the period&rsquo;s most precise measurement devices, and delivering an experiment of insurmountable scientific import.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to Meselson and Stahl, who did deliver an answer aligning with scientific expectation, the results of the Michelson-Morley experiments were disruptive. But it is this disruptive nature of their results that prompted the identification of the limitations of our knowledge and opened the door to revisit and reformulate our physics, leading to the acceptance of Einstein&rsquo;s special theory of relativity and the abandonment of the Newtonian framework. The design was beautiful, the setup careful and original, and the results were disruptive, surprising and awe-provoking. Just like many artworks that challenge our fundamental assumptions about ourselves and our place in the world, beautiful experiments can deliver results that prompt us to reconsider our working assumptions. Their aesthetic significance is intricately related to our state of understanding, and illustrates the diverse nature of the aesthetic experiences that scientific products and artworks can elicit.&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2021-12-15 21:14:14', 11, 6262);

Critics are protective of the good ones, to preserve their magic: &lsquo;Because the film depends so much on the exquisite unravelling of its plot, it would be unfair to describe much more,&rsquo; as the film critic Roger Ebert wrote of &lt;i&gt;Chinatown&lt;/i&gt; (1974). &lsquo;It would be sinful to spoil its twists,&rsquo; said another critic, Richard Brody, some 45 years later, of Jordan Peele&rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Us&lt;/i&gt; (2019).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a twist lands wrong, it makes a lasting impression too. A bad twist feels like a cheap trick. It&rsquo;s shoddy. It makes us feel not just disappointed but ill used. We may be in the world of fiction, but our sense of grievance is real. The finale of the TV drama &lt;i&gt;Lost&lt;/i&gt;, in 2010, the culmination of six years of mystery, misdirection and anticipation, inspired this reaction in many of its viewers. Its co-creator J J Abrams complained: &lsquo;For years, I had people praising &lt;i&gt;Lost&lt;/i&gt; to death, and now they say: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so pissed at you for the end of &lt;i&gt;Lost&lt;/i&gt;.&rdquo; &hellip; I&rsquo;ve not yet heard the pitch of what the ending should have been. I&rsquo;ve just heard: &ldquo;That sucked.&rdquo;&rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twists are just one kind of narrative surprise, of course. Stories can always surprise us simply by doing something sudden and unexpected. Jump scares are a staple of &lt;a href=&quot;https://aeon.co/essays/horror-is-a-dark-and-piercing-reflection-of-our-anxious-times&quot;&gt;horror&lt;/a&gt; and suspense films because they are &lt;a href=&quot;https://aeon.co/essays/fear-not-horror-movies-build-community-and-emotional-resilience&quot;&gt;reliably&lt;/a&gt; surprising in a very basic and straightforward way. Absurdist juxtapositions and wild variations in style can also be surprising, and often delightful. But a surprise twist offers some rewards and faces some constraints that jump scares and absurdism don&rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a big reveal, a story pulls the rug out from under you in some important way. You thought one thing was going on, but it turns out it was something else, all along: Darth Vader was Luke&rsquo;s father. The lost necklace was only costume jewellery. Rosebud was the sled. For a surprise to work as a twist, some new information has to override an old understanding. For the twist to be satisfying, it has to make sense &ndash; or at least to feel as if it makes sense &ndash; in retrospect. If not, you are likely to feel like Nic Pizzolatto, the creator and original showrunner of the crime series &lt;i&gt;True Detective&lt;/i&gt; (2014-19), who once said: &lsquo;I cannot think of anything more insulting as an audience&rsquo; than to invest hours or weeks in a story &lsquo;and then to be told it was a lie &ndash; that what you were seeing wasn&rsquo;t really what was happening.&rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stories with surprise twists involve several noteworthy kinds of labour. First, like any story, they ask their audience to put in the time and effort to build up specific ideas about what is going on. We invest our attention and affections in characters and situations. Then, in the wake of the surprise, we&rsquo;re supposed to undo a lot of that work and do &lt;i&gt;new&lt;/i&gt; work instead, reconstructing our understanding of what&rsquo;s going on to fit the surprising new information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stories themselves also have to do special kinds of work, to forestall the kind of undesirable reaction Pizzolatto described. Storytellers have an arsenal of devices they can deploy to help prevent some of these unhappy outcomes. I&rsquo;ve written about these tactics in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674980204&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Elements of Surprise&lt;/i&gt; (2018), which is all about how these methods take advantage of general cognitive tendencies and blind spots in the way we think. Their chief goal is to persuade the audience that, first, the pre-twist understanding was a perhaps understandable, but fundamentally mistaken, interpretation of the facts as given, and, second, that the post-twist understanding is entirely consistent with those same facts. They manage this sleight of hand with an obliging confederate: your own brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first and most crucial tool for setting up a twist is the brute fact that we never depend strictly on what we see and hear as we make our way through the world, or as we make sense of what people tell us. We are continually making inferences and filling in gaps. This means that any story has many opportunities to let us draw our own conclusions, while keeping open the option of telling us something different, later on. So, for instance, (&lt;a href=&quot;https://aeon.co/videos/spoiler-alert-does-knowing-how-it-ends-make-fiction-more-fun&quot;&gt;spoilers&lt;/a&gt;!) the surprise at the end of &lt;i&gt;The Sixth Sense&lt;/i&gt; (1999), that Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a ghost, is set up in just this way. In the opening sequence, we see Crowe get shot. In the following scene, we see him walking around, uninjured. Time seems to have passed. No one tells us that he has recovered from the gunshot; we infer it. Only later, we can look back and say: &lsquo;Oh, I &lt;i&gt;assumed&lt;/i&gt;&hellip;&rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, like a stage magician &ndash; or a pickpocket &ndash; writers can take advantage of the way we think to keep us looking in one direction while important things are happening somewhere else, burying plot-critical information where it can be uncovered later, without drawing your attention to its significance too early. The hold that stories naturally have on our attention and imagination helps the process along. The psychologist Melanie Green and her colleagues have &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11079236/&quot;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that people are more open to persuasion as a function of what they call &lsquo;narrative transportation&rsquo;. When a story is gripping, vivid, engaging and immersive, we are less on guard, less concerned about whether all the details add up, and more willing to follow a narrative wherever it wants to take us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When something unexpected happens, however mundane, it kicks off a particular kind of remembering&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once our guard is down, we take more cognitive shortcuts. This fact opens the door to many tactical manoeuvres. In the 1970s, the psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/1738360&quot;&gt;observed&lt;/a&gt; that people often take an approach to reasoning that can be described as &lsquo;anchoring and adjustment&rsquo;. Presented with some piece of information &ndash; the asking price for a condo, early results from exit polls, a sample answer to a trivia question &ndash; people tend to use that information as a starting point in formulating their own estimates, hypotheses and predictions. If I ask you to guess the lifespan of the average tortoise, after first asking you whether most tortoises live past the age of nine, you&rsquo;re likely to name a lower number than your friend who was asked whether they often live past the age of 70. The same cognitive logic is what makes red herrings so effective. They exert a gravitational pull on our speculation. Information can also act as an anchor when we know it&rsquo;s false or even irrelevant. If you recognise some false trail as a red herring, it can still affect what Tversky and Kahneman described as the &lsquo;availability&rsquo; of other ideas. It will constrain your imagination and make some lines of reasoning much easier to see than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Characters make particularly useful vessels for misleading information, because they add deniability. A character can lie or be mistaken without making the story as a whole inconsistent or dishonest. This handy fact works nicely with another predictable feature of human cognition: our relatively bad memory for source information. Especially if we&rsquo;re distracted (say, by some compelling, emotionally engaging story content), we can encounter claims in dubious settings, or even see them being debunked, but later remember only that we&rsquo;ve heard them somewhere before. Then if we encounter the claims again, that sense of familiarity can make us more likely to take them seriously. The psychologist Daniel Schacter, a major figure in the cognitive and neurological study of memory, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hmhbooks.com/shop/books/the-seven-sins-of-memory-updated-edition/9780358325680&quot;&gt;calls&lt;/a&gt; this failing and others like it the &lsquo;sins of memory&rsquo;, and stories can use them to plant information in places where we are likely to remember the misleading bits while losing track of the caveats. Fortunately, despite our tendency to lose track of this information, we never fully lose track of the &lt;i&gt;distinction&lt;/i&gt;, so if a story shows us that a source we trusted was unreliable, we get it. The source is blown, but the story itself can still be on the up-and-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If stories play their cards right, they can even introduce entirely new information at the d&eacute;nouement but finesse the introduction so that it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be new. A very common and surprisingly dependable example is the case of the underspecified clue: Sherlock Holmes observes the knees of a suspect&rsquo;s trousers, but &lsquo;reminds&rsquo; Watson of the fact that they were dirty and worn only as the solution to the mystery is revealed. Miss Marple is told only that there was a maid in the house where a murder took place but explains later that she knew what happened as soon as she &lsquo;heard there was a pretty young girl in the house&rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This strategy takes advantage of the fact that, in general, when something unexpected happens, however mundane, it kicks off a particular kind of remembering. Conveniently for storytellers, surprise biases this process by enhancing the retrieval of surprise-congruent information. So we remember &ndash; yes, we&rsquo;ve heard about trouser knees, or yes, we&rsquo;ve heard about a maid named Gladys &ndash; and the pieces fit together. The fact that different revelations would have been equally consistent with the partial information we had at the beginning is harder to see, because that&rsquo;s not how we&rsquo;re built to think about outcomes and predictability. Once something &lt;i&gt;has&lt;/i&gt; happened, that&rsquo;s important data about what we &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; have predicted on the basis of whatever partial information we had available to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This way of thinking about the past is a &lsquo;sin&rsquo; in some respects, but useful in everyday experience. Imagine that you&rsquo;re walking in the park, enjoying the sunshine, effortlessly navigating the terrain, when, unexpectedly, you slip. What happened? One theory is that your sensorimotor systems were doing predictive processing, making models on the basis of past experience to anticipate what would happen next. When the model is wrong, we&rsquo;re surprised. (When the surprise is too small to register with our conscious minds, we borrow a term associated with the great information theorist &lt;a href=&quot;https://aeon.co/essays/how-a-polymath-transformed-our-understanding-of-information&quot;&gt;Claude Shannon&lt;/a&gt; and call it &lsquo;surprisal&rsquo;.) When that happens, the system needs to revise its appraisal of the relevant recent past in light of what it turned out to mean. It makes sense to give less attention to the bits of evidence that were also consistent with other outcomes, because they didn&rsquo;t serve us well. A story can leverage this tendency to give us loose connections that &lt;i&gt;feel&lt;/i&gt; convincing and tight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s fun and interesting to identify the cognitive principles that explain how story structures produce their effects, but authors and screenwriters don&rsquo;t have to be cognitive scientists to make use of these strategies. Good storytellers know by instinct and from experience that they are effective. And the central principle, above all, is to do what will produce the desired effect. The point is to build a device that works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a story can play by all these rules, it can be engineered with structures that seem to its authors to be up to code in every critical respect, and still infuriate its audience. Ebert, for instance, loved both Ang Lee&rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Life of Pi&lt;/i&gt; (2012) &ndash; a sentimental fable that uses an existential twist to raise questions about faith and trauma &ndash; and David Mamet&rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;House of Games&lt;/i&gt; (1987) &ndash; a tightly structured, sentiment-free thriller with a deceptive sting in its tail &ndash; but loathed the twist ending of &lt;i&gt;The Usual Suspects&lt;/i&gt; (1995). &lsquo;To the degree that you will want to see this movie, it will be because of the surprise,&rsquo; he warned, but its &lsquo;blinding revelation &hellip; filled me not with delight but with the feeling that the writer, Christopher McQuarrie, and the director, Bryan Singer, would have been better off unravelling their carefully knit sleeve of fiction and just telling us a story about their characters.&rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least McQuarrie and Singer can comfort themselves that Ebert had a minority view. The writers, cast and crew of &lt;i&gt;Lost&lt;/i&gt; are in a less enviable boat. In a recent retrospective, Henry Ian Cusick, the actor who played Desmond, insisted: &lsquo;The show is not about the ending.&rsquo; But there are plenty of viewers out there who are, as we say now, going to die mad about it. What went wrong? For some viewers, at least, &lt;i&gt;Lost&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Usual Suspects&lt;/i&gt; fumbled their work at the final stage. They let their audience walk away without first thoroughly teaching them to appreciate and accept what has happened. They neglected to &lt;i&gt;cool out the mark&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more invested you get that there is something wonderful and magical inside the box, the worse it gets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years into &lt;i&gt;Lost&lt;/i&gt;&rsquo;s six-year run, Abrams gave a TED Talk about his storytelling philosophy. He was inspired, he said, by the &lsquo;mystery box&rsquo; he bought from a magic shop as a child. The box was sold as a deal: $50-worth of magic tricks for $15. In exchange for the savings, of course, you didn&rsquo;t get to choose what specific tricks would be inside. Lots of vendors offer this sort of lucky-dip discount. It&rsquo;s a way of unloading some under-performing merchandise while offering customers a fun little see-what-you-get experience. But Abrams never did open his mystery box. He kept it around, unopened, for years. Why? Because it reminds him of his grandfather, but also because &lsquo;it represents infinite possibility. It represents hope. It represents potential.&rsquo; And so, as he tells it in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/j_j_abrams_the_mystery_box?language=en&quot;&gt;TED Talk&lt;/a&gt;, anyway, he had a realisation about his job as a storyteller: &lsquo;What are stories but mystery boxes? &hellip; And the mystery box, in honour of my grandfather, stays closed.&rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2021-12-15 21:22:52', 622, 26111),

It\'s not exactly the kind of place you\'d expect to watch a gripping political drama about two cities on the cusp of war. And League\'s larger-than-life champions don\'t immediately seem like the right soil for emotional character development. But that\'s partly what makes Arcane so magical&mdash;as well as its extraordinary, hand-painted aesthetic. It defies expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you\'re not a League of Legends fan&mdash;or even if you actively despise it&mdash;Arcane is still something you should watch. It\'s not weighed down by complicated lore or timeline shenanigans nearly as much as, say, Netflix\'s The Witcher. That\'s because Arcane isn\'t about League of Legends\' champions, but the regular folk they used to be. In that way, Arcane mirrors a lot of superhero origin stories, like Christopher Nolan\'s Batman Begins. It\'s also better too. There\'s epic fight scenes, chemical mutations, and reality-tearing magic, but, unlike a lot of superhero flicks, there\'s also a humanness to Arcane that makes it especially gripping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The series, which is available on Netflix, is broken up into three acts, each containing three episodes. The first act aired today, November 6, with the rest airing each Saturday following until November 20. If the first act is any indication, Arcane is going to be one hell of a trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Family matters&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story follows two sisters, Vi and Powder, who live in a desiccated ghetto on the fringes of the gleaming and prosperous city of Piltover. As a mecca of science, Piltover is a dream for aristocrats and academics alike. But the city has a dark underside&mdash;literally. On the other side of a wide river is the Undercity, a chemical wasteland full of miscreants, vagrants, and Piltover\'s refuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The violence that routinely erupts between Piltover\'s haves and the Undercity\'s have-nots isn\'t just some background subplot, though. In the first scene of episode 1, Vi and her little sister find the corpses of their parents in the wreckage of a violent clash between Undercity residents and Piltover\'s cops. It\'s a somber scene that sets the tone for the next few episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing I love about Arcane is its pacing. After that grim intro, we\'re whisked forward a few years as Vi, Powder, and two other orphans sneak into Piltover to stage a daring heist. Things naturally go awry, kicking into motion a chain reaction that threatens to not only tear Piltover and the Undercity to pieces, but Vi and Powder\'s adoptive family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Arcane Episode 1 Recap&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/THGGAmSTMp9vLtQ78shxtd-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/THGGAmSTMp9vLtQ78shxtd-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/THGGAmSTMp9vLtQ78shxtd-970-80.jpg 970w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: Riot Games)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By episode 2, Arcane\'s scope is blown wide open with the introduction of Jayce, Viktor, and several other notable League champs. Blinded by idealism and ambition, these two Piltover academics are working to harness the power of magic through science. It\'s a dangerous endeavour that initially draws the ire of Piltover\'s governing body, lead by the lovable and quirky Heimerdinger, a tiny, ewok-esque creature sporting a monocle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the scope continues to widen, it soon becomes clear that Arcane isn\'t just about two street rats trying to survive in a cruel world. It\'s a multidimensional story that dances effortlessly between an intimate character portrait of Vi and Powder, a sprawling high-fantasy political drama, and a seedy cops-and-robbers crime thriller. And it all builds toward a climax that is as intense as it is horrifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I won\'t say much about the third episode at the risk of spoiling it, but what makes it work is largely thanks to how well Arcane fleshes out its characters. You\'d think League champs like Vi and Powder would steal every scene (they definitely try), but I was surprised at how attached I got to Arcane\'s other cast of characters, specifically Vander. He\'s a character type you\'ve likely seen before: a brooding father figure beginning to buckle under the weight of the responsibility he feels not only to his city, but Vi, Powder, and the other orphans he\'s adopted. But because Arcane takes such care to explore Vander\'s motivations and backstory, it\'s hard &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to care about him. So even when I could sometimes guess what tragedies lay in wait, it didn\'t rob those scenes of their emotional gravity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if Arcane\'s emotional core doesn\'t connect at the same level with you, I\'d encourage anyone to watch it just for the animation alone. Riot\'s partnership with French animation studio Fortiche has delivered some amazing trailers, but Arcane is at a level that I\'ve never seen outside of big-budget movies made by Dreamworks or Pixar. The hand-painted art is sumptuous and evocative and there\'s a masterful use of lighting to create striking bits of contrast&mdash;especially in the neon greens of the Undercity. Just as importantly, the 3D modelling of characters is really expressive, which helps sell moments of tragedy. Arcane just looks so damn &lt;i&gt;cool&lt;/i&gt;. Every scene is lavish, each character design distinct. Story aside, Arcane is an astounding work of 3D animation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image 1 of 7&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Arcane episode 1 recap&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ycueoe3wgpDLUsx9r4hxsU-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ycueoe3wgpDLUsx9r4hxsU-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ycueoe3wgpDLUsx9r4hxsU-970-80.jpg 970w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: Riot Games)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Arcane Episode 1 Recap&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jrwTMo9ekezGZUJWeUSrad-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jrwTMo9ekezGZUJWeUSrad-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jrwTMo9ekezGZUJWeUSrad-970-80.jpg 970w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: Riot Games)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Arcane Episode 1 Recap&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ybhbte4CnUvusKHW7kdvHd-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ybhbte4CnUvusKHW7kdvHd-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ybhbte4CnUvusKHW7kdvHd-970-80.jpg 970w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: Riot Games)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Arcane Episode 1 Recap&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q5MCaGnBQs23EYHUtnqo3d-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q5MCaGnBQs23EYHUtnqo3d-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q5MCaGnBQs23EYHUtnqo3d-970-80.jpg 970w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: Riot Games)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Arcane Episode 1 Recap&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CkxExUn8GYZMsCFY9ZEppc-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CkxExUn8GYZMsCFY9ZEppc-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CkxExUn8GYZMsCFY9ZEppc-970-80.jpg 970w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: Riot Games)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Arcane Episode 1 Recap&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/npjU7uXhLnbqiA2kgtppdc-320-80.png 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/npjU7uXhLnbqiA2kgtppdc-650-80.png 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/npjU7uXhLnbqiA2kgtppdc-970-80.png 970w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: Riot Games)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Arcane Episode 1 Recap&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j7zt8T75Vc2XwoGKXoRo4c-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j7zt8T75Vc2XwoGKXoRo4c-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j7zt8T75Vc2XwoGKXoRo4c-970-80.jpg 970w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: Riot Games)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s also delightfully kinetic. In one early fight scene, Vi, Powder, and two friends are dragged into a vicious scrap with some rival street kids. It\'s a chaotic brawl filled with slow-mo closeups of fists breaking noses and faces contorting comically as knees and elbows slam into them. It\'s also a precursor to much more intense, high-stakes bouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between these fights, quiet moments of Vi and Powder bonding, and the boiling tension in the wake of their ill-fated heist, there\'s just not a lot I &lt;i&gt;don\'t&lt;/i&gt; like about Arcane. My biggest complaint is that I wish the relationship between Piltover and the Undercity was more explicitly detailed, as it wasn\'t always clear &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; the two cities had so much bad blood between them. It\'s a minor gripe, though, especially when there\'s still six more episodes left in this series and plenty more time to explore these characters and the conflict they\'re wrapped in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I can\'t wait. Arcane\'s first act manages to pull off what so many fantasy and sci-fi series fail to do. It walks a tightrope between introducing us to a complex new world while maintaining an intimate focus on the people who make that world worth caring about. League of Legends fans rejoice: Arcane\'s first three episodes are amazing.&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2021-12-15 21:04:26', 1616, 6161),

Vi and Powder are just two of several main characters, and to introduce the rest, this episode doubles back to the orphan\'s lab heist-gone-wrong. The owner of that lab&mdash;who happened to arrive just in time to get caught in the explosion&mdash;is Jayce, another iconic League champion who, at this point in time, is an ambitious, young academic. Jayce is just returning from his trip to the Undercity where he stocked up on illicit doodads. Helping him is Caitlyn, another soon-to-be League champ, who belongs to the powerful noble family who sponsors Jayce\'s research. Just as he realizes someone has broken into his lab and barred the door, the magical crystal Powder dropped explodes, knocking him unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a flashback, we learn that Jayce and his mother were once lost in a terrible blizzard in the frozen lands of Freljord. Just as Jayce\'s mom begins to succumb to the cold, a wizard appears and saves their lives by using a magical crystal to teleport them far away. As a gesture, the wizard then hands Jayce the now-spent mana crystal. That moment, we come to learn, profoundly affected Jayce\'s approach to scientific research: Something that will land him in hot water with Piltover\'s governing body, The Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;In pursuit of progress&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the title sequence, we cut to Jayce in his now ruined lab being interrogated by none other than Grayson, the Enforcer that works with Vander to try and keep peace between Piltover and Zaun. Turns out, Jayce\'s experiments aren\'t only dangerous (obviously) but also highly illegal. Making matters more complicated, the assistant to the dean of The Academy&mdash;where Jayce studies&mdash;is also present. LoL players will immediately recognize him as Viktor, but he\'s a far cry from the mad scientist he\'s portrayed as in the game. In Arcane, he\'s young, thin, and walks with a cane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viktor informs Jayce that his illicit experiments have drawn the ire of The Council&mdash;the head of which is also The Academy\'s dean. And Jayce is to be arrested and must plead his case before them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Arcane Episode 1 Recap&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jrwTMo9ekezGZUJWeUSrad-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jrwTMo9ekezGZUJWeUSrad-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jrwTMo9ekezGZUJWeUSrad-970-80.jpg 970w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: Riot Games)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In prison, Jayce is visited by the dean himself, who turns out to be none other than Heimerdinger, yet another iconic League champ. If you\'re a bit confused by Heimerdinger\'s fluffy ewok-esque appearance, just know that he belongs to a race of extremely long-lived magical creatures called Yordles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jayce reveals to Heimerdinger that his experiments are all in pursuit of finding a way to harness magic through science. But Heimerdinger shoots the idea down, saying that the arcane is too dangerous and unpredictable to be controlled and that some avenues of inquiry are best left untouched. His advice to Jayce: Admit he was being ambitious, make no mention of magic, and The Council will probably let him off with a warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, back in the Undercity, Vi, Powder, Milo, and Claggor are laying low in an abandoned arcade hoping their escapades topside will soon blow over. Vi practices boxing against a large punching-bag-robot, giving us some clear indication that she\'s unnaturally good in a fight. Meanwhile, we get more of a sense of Powder\'s own strengths after she manages to fix a target practice range and proves herself to be a crack shot with a gun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Milo once again bemoans what deadweight Powder is for the group, just outside a group of Enforcers shakes down Undercity residents in hopes of identifying the orphans. When one of the Undercity locals spits on an Enforcer, he\'s thrown through the window of the arcade and the orphans are discovered. Since Powder is still holding onto her satchel of stolen mana crystals, the orphans have no choice but to run. A chase ensues, and the group only barely manages to escape thanks to Echo (AKA Little Man). &quot;We need to hide those crystals,&quot; Vi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in Piltover, we meet Councillor Mel Medarda, an obscenely wealthy aristocrat and member of the council that rules over Piltover. Medarda is hopelessly ambitious and, despite her great wealth, feels inadequate next to the rest of her family. To raise her status, she seeks some new initiative or discovery that\'ll &quot;help put Piltover on the map.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then cut to Caitlyn sitting with her parents, Jayce\'s patrons, discussing his upcoming trial. Despite his recklessness, Caitlyn\'s mother is resolute in defending him at the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Arcane Episode 1 Recap&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/npjU7uXhLnbqiA2kgtppdc-320-80.png 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/npjU7uXhLnbqiA2kgtppdc-650-80.png 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/npjU7uXhLnbqiA2kgtppdc-970-80.png 970w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: Riot Games)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we can hear more, we\'re whisked back to the Undercity where dozens have gathered in The Last Tap to discuss what to do about Piltover\'s Enforcers forcing their way into Zaun and causing trouble. The residents want to fight back, but Vander reminds them of what happened years ago when they tried to cross the bridge into Piltover and countless people were slaughtered&mdash;Vi and Powder\'s parents among them. &quot;This will blow over, we just have to stand together.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People are too upset to care. A woman named Svarka challenges Vander\'s authority as the unspoken leader of the Undercity and walks out, followed by dozens of civilians. Meanwhile, the orphans watch from a corner, wondering why Vander is preaching pacifism. Echo then spills the beans: Vander has a deal with the Enforcers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back to Piltover, where Jayce arrives for his trial with The Council. Following Heimerdinger\'s advice, Jayce humbly begs for forgiveness and admits to his crimes. Caitlyn\'s mother backs him up, testifying to his idealistic nature and gift for scientific research, but The Council isn\'t entirely convinced. As they debate the merit of Jayce\'s research, his pride gets the better of him and he exposes the true nature of his research: to harness magic through science. As Jayce begins a speech about all the breakthroughs his research could lead to, his conviction seems to make a noticeable impact on Councillor Mel Medarda and Viktor, who watches from the audience. But before anyone else can be swayed by Jayce\'s idealism, Heimerdinger cuts him off. Turns out, being a 300-year-old furball means he\'s had ample opportunity to see magic firsthand, as Heimerdinger once witnessed it destroy an entire, unnamed city. &quot;That cannot happen here,&quot; he warns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Council agrees, and just as Jayce is about to be sentenced to exile, his mother begs to make her case for why Jayce should be allowed to come home. Her words move The Council, and Heimerdinger proposes to have Jayce merely expelled from The Academy instead of outright exiled from the city. The Council votes and sides with Heimerdinger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dirty deals&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Undercity, Marcus, the Enforcer who accompanied Grayson on her clandestine visit to Vander in episode 1, arrives at what looks to be an abandoned seafood market. Something sinister is going on here, though, as he discovers neon-pink tendrils of &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; growing out of a dark passageway. Just then, the villainous man with the black eye from the end of episode 1 emerges. His name is Silco, and he implies to Marcus that he wants to make a deal and in exchange will offer up Vi, Powder, Milo, and Claggor to the Enforcers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we can learn more about this deal, however, we cut to Jayce in his childhood bedroom where he argues with his mother who pleads for him to give up on his dream of harnessing magic. &quot;If my own family won\'t help me, I\'ll find someone who will,&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Arcane Episode 1 Recap&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CkxExUn8GYZMsCFY9ZEppc-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CkxExUn8GYZMsCFY9ZEppc-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CkxExUn8GYZMsCFY9ZEppc-970-80.jpg 970w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: Riot Games)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That someone is Viktor. As he and Heimerdinger lock up Jayce\'s research notes for disposal, Viktor innocently inquires about some of the hurdles preventing a breakthrough. He\'s clearly been swayed by Jayce\'s dream, and as Heimerdinger leaves, he swipes Jayce\'s journal containing all of his research on the mana gems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Silco\'s underwater lab, he talks with Deckard&mdash;he\'s the street thug from episode 1 who tried to rob Vi and the orphans after they made their escape from Piltover. Silco proves himself to be every bit as nefarious as he looks, and entices Deckard to ingest that strange pink liquid that Silco and the yet unnamed scientist gave to the rat in the last episode. &quot;It\'s time to let the monster out,&quot; Silco says as Deckard drinks the potion and is immediately transformed into a hulking mutant. That\'s not good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jayce, after walking out on his mother, arrives at Caitlyn\'s family home to find the gate barred. Caitlyn is waiting outside in the rain to tell Jayce that her family wants nothing to do with him and is revoking their sponsorship. And, perhaps worst of all, Jayce and Caitlyn cannot be friends anymore&mdash;though Caitlyn doesn\'t seem too keen on following that order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then cut to Enforcers Grayson and Marcus now giving a briefing to the Council on their efforts to locate Vi and the orphans. Now that they have some idea of the nature of Jayce\'s experiments, the Council is terrified that the mana crystals Powder stole could cause irreparable damage in the wrong hands. Despite Grayson\'s protests that they shouldn\'t exert their force too harshly in Zaun, the Councillors urge her to &quot;turn the city upside down if they have to.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcus takes that order extra seriously and, in the next scene, arrives at The Last Drop to search the place&mdash;suspecting that Vander is hiding the wanted orphans. Vander triggers a silent alarm that warns the kids to hide as Enforcers enter The Last Drop\'s backroom. Meanwhile, Marcus threatens Vander who refuses to be goaded into violence and then antagonizes the rest of the bar\'s patrons, making Vander seem weak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this is overheard by Vi, Powder, Milo, Claggor, and Echo, who are hiding in the ceiling. After the Enforcers leave, Vi gives Vander an ultimatum: Either he needs to fight to defend the Undercity or she will. Seeing that the situation is clearly spinning out of control, Vander takes Vi to the bridge that separates Piltover and Zaun&mdash;where her parents died&mdash;to try and reason with her. As they talk, we\'re shown small memorials people have made to those that died that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s here that we get some crucial answers into what exactly happened that day. After a lifetime of subjugation and oppression by Piltover, Vander led a small army of Zaunites across the bridge, where they were swiftly cut down by the Enforcers. While Vander sympathizes with Vi\'s dream of making a better life for her and Powder, he warns her that fighting for it could cost her the people she holds most dear. &quot;Nobody wins in war, Vi,&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vander isn\'t the only one with a heavy heart, though. Back in his lab, Jayce steps out onto the ruined ledge where his balcony used to be. Behind him, we\'re shown a letter and his bracelet containing the spent mana gem given to him by the mysterious wizard that saved his life. Jayce\'s intentions become clear: He\'s going to kill himself.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Arcane Episode 1 Recap&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j7zt8T75Vc2XwoGKXoRo4c-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j7zt8T75Vc2XwoGKXoRo4c-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j7zt8T75Vc2XwoGKXoRo4c-970-80.jpg 970w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: Riot Games)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just before he falls to his death, Viktor interrupts him. They talk about his research and Viktor says he was intrigued by Jayce\'s speech at the trial. When Jayce mourns his ruined reputation, Viktor sympathizes with him. As an orphan from the undercity and &quot;a cripple,&quot; he\'s spent his entire life being underestimated and looked down upon. Viktor was only able to climb to the role of assistant to the dean thanks to his belief in himself, and it\'s a gift he wants to give to Jayce&mdash;to help him complete his research and realize his dream. &quot;When you\'re going to change the world, don\'t ask for permission,&quot; Viktor says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vi returns from her talk with Vander to find Milo, Claggor, and Powder preparing for war with Piltover. Powder shows Vi all the new homemade explosives she\'s been working on. &quot;They\'re going to work this time, I know it,&quot; she says. Clearly feeling the weight of what\'s about to happen, Vi encourages Powder to find strength in what makes her different from everyone else. As she leaves, she hands Powder the stuffed bunny she showed her in the last episode. It\'s clear that Vi is planning something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then cut to Marcus and Grayson arguing in her office. By antagonizing Vander and the patrons of The Last Drop, Grayson believes Marcus has set the stage for all-out violence between the two cities. But, suddenly, they\'re interrupted by a message via pneumatic tube. It\'s from Vander and he wants to talk. &quot;Maybe it\'s not too late,&quot; Grayson says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things don\'t quite add up, though. Vander is back at the bar&mdash;now empty as it\'s the calm before the storm&mdash;and fixing Powder a drink. Seeing how forlorn Powder looks, Vander notices she has Vi\'s stuffed bunny and realizes, with a look of terror, that Vi is up to something. Just then, we cut to a squad of Enforcers led by Grayson and Marcus marching down the street toward Benzo\'s shop. Vi is inside, and she\'s going to turn herself in to save Powder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that\'s where episode 2 ends. It\'s a whirlwind of an episode, one that sets an exhilarating pace as we jump from so many different points of view. And I love how successfully it ratchets up the tension between Piltover and Zaun, setting the stage for the finale of Act 1.

To see this, try one of my favourite philosophical parlour tricks. Right now, believe something you think is false: that the Sun is just a big lightbulb, for instance. Don&rsquo;t imagine you believe it &ndash; really believe it. Become so confident in it that you&rsquo;d bet good money that it&rsquo;s true. When I try this, I feel a funny cognitive block, as if there&rsquo;s a built-in aversion to believing on command, especially anything I already think is wrong. Unfortunately, this doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s easy to believe only truths. If learning and thinking were as easy as deciding to let nothing but the facts in, we would never make mistakes. And yet we stumble into falsehood all the time. We can all think of times we were convinced of something that turned out to be wrong, and we all have our favourite perceptual illusions, ambiguous images and pictures of impossible scenes, which drive it home that things aren&rsquo;t always how they seem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With such a track record, it makes sense to reflect on why our thinking sometimes goes awry, and why it sometimes goes right. Epistemology, the philosophical study of knowledge, belief and evidence, starts here, with our fallibility. And from this beginning, there are many paths for epistemology to take, and many sorts of questions to set us down these trails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, we could continue by asking about the nature of thinking itself. Does thinking amount to nothing more than forming and reforming beliefs? Or is it something else entirely? Another option is to ask what counts as &lsquo;success&rsquo; or &lsquo;correctness&rsquo; in believing. This second path concerns what epistemologists call &lsquo;justification&rsquo;. Since true thoughts don&rsquo;t come with a special glow announcing themselves as true, we can&rsquo;t use truth as a marker for well-formed, worthwhile beliefs. Rather, we might look for something else to sort the good beliefs and opinions from the bad &ndash; something that justifies some beliefs rather than others, and that explains why some are credible and some aren&rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, this is the big question for many epistemologists: what justification and credibility actually are. But, along the way, the path narrows, and a new question arises over the role justification plays in finding out things. While a just-the-facts filter can&rsquo;t solve the problem of avoiding falsehood and getting the truth, does the &lt;i&gt;credibility&lt;/i&gt; of a thought need to make itself obvious to you in a way that truth can&rsquo;t? Or is it enough for your opinion to be credible, full stop? These questions lead to the forbiddingly named internalism/externalism debate in epistemology, but don&rsquo;t let the -isms scare you off. As we&rsquo;ll see, academic questions about justification lead to much deeper questions about the subject matter of epistemology itself.&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2021-12-15 21:16:14', 262, 26267);

And for two episodes, that fuse has burned slowly as we\'re whisked from one location to the next to better understand the political and interpersonal drama unfolding in the wake of that fateful heist. And after all that anticipation, episode 3\'s explosive ending is as horrifying as it is cathartic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before that can happen, there\'s a little bit of fuse left to burn. Episode 3 opens to the eerie sounds of a woman singing before the camera fades in and we see a man floating deep underwater. &quot;Ever wonder what it\'s like to drown?&quot; Silco asks. The man is him&mdash;albeit a much younger him, without the facial scars and black eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s a peaceful, if somber moment, one that is interrupted by flashes of violence as Silco is held underwater by a pair of burly hands, blood gushing from his eye. Someone tried to drown him, once, and as Silco\'s monologue continues, it\'s clear who it was: Vander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bad blood&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of episode 2, Vi was getting ready to turn herself over to the Enforcers. But that final scene was playing a trick on us. As the door to Benzo\'s shop opens and Vi stands to meet her fate, it\'s not Enforcers that greet her but Vander and Benzo. Vander is not going to let her sacrifice herself to save everyone. &quot;Protect the family,&quot; he says, as he shoves her through a door into a storeroom and locks her inside. Vander has decided if anyone should take the fall, it should be him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just then, Grayson, Marcus, and their squad of Enforcers arrive. Vander offers himself as the sacrificial lamb, but Grayson is hesitant&mdash;she knows that he\'s the only one keeping the Undercity from falling into chaos. &quot;It\'s the only way,&quot; Vander explains. With no other option, the Enforcers arrest Vander and lead him outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vi struggles to free herself from the locked store room but stops when she hears shouting from outside. Climbing up to a storm window, she\'s just in time to see an Enforcer reduced to a bloody paste&mdash;gore spraying across the window and blocking her view. Something is going terribly wrong. Outside, we see Grayson covered in blood. Murdered, along with the rest of the Enforcers except Marcus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silco emerges from the fog and Benzo tries to attack him but is instantly slaughtered by a monster. It\'s Deckard, mutated from the serum he ingested in episode 2. Marcus says this wasn\'t the deal he and Silco had made, to which Silco replies, &quot;Deals change,&quot; and hands him a bag of coins. Deckard knocks Vander out and takes him away with Silco, leaving Vi alone in the locked storeroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Arcane Episode 1 Recap&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/npjU7uXhLnbqiA2kgtppdc-320-80.png 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/npjU7uXhLnbqiA2kgtppdc-650-80.png 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/npjU7uXhLnbqiA2kgtppdc-970-80.png 970w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: Riot Games)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Magical mayhem&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back topside, Viktor and Jayce try to complete his research but can\'t without more of his confiscated equipment. Viktor convinces Jayce to break into Heimerdinger\'s lab, explaining that he\'s not content with merely being the dean\'s assistant. Like Jayce, he wants to change the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vi doesn\'t stay trapped in that storeroom for long. She\'s rescued by Echo, who saw everything and is now traumatized by the death of his own adoptive father, Benzo. Fortunately, Echo saw where Silco and Deckard took Vander&mdash;the fish market that conceals Silco\'s underwater lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, Silco reveals his ultimate goal: To transform the Undercity into a nation equal to Piltover in terms of power and influence. One that doesn\'t bow to the Council and Enforcers. To achieve that goal, he plans to use that mutant serum&mdash;called Shimmer&mdash;to &quot;scare&quot; Piltover into supplication. It\'s a dream, we discover, Vander and Silco once shared. Until Vander betrayed him by trying to drown him in one of the chemical-infused rivers of the Undercity. Silco had a cut on his face, and the river toxins are what scorched it and blackened his eye. Silco managed to stab Vander using his own knife and escape, and the two have been enemies ever since. Vander tries to persuade Silco away from war, but Silco simply believes Vander has lost his nerve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jayce and Viktor arrive at Heimerdinger\'s lab in the dead of night and attempt to sneak in but are caught by Councilor Mel Medarda. She also wants in on the project, and offers to buy the duo the time they need to complete the next phase of their research and attempt to stabilize one of the mana gems. They\'re successful, and the mana gem activates without exploding&mdash;though nearly everyone in Piltover sees the unmistakable blue energy it radiates. Heimerdinger arrives with Enforcers and finds his lab barricaded while Jayce and Viktor complete their experiment. Just as Heimerdinger gets the door open, Jayce successfully creates a stable magical spell. &quot;You\'ve actually done it,&quot; Heimerdinger says, but before he can shut down the experiment, Mel Medarda arrives and says the decision isn\'t his to make. The Council needs to decide if Jayce\'s research, which he called Hextech, is now worth pursuing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vi arrives at The Last Drop and finds Milo, Claggor, and Powder preparing to fight the Enforcers. She tells them what happened and the group resolves to go and save Vander. All except Powder. Vi knows it\'s too dangerous, so she tells her to hide. Vi also gives her a flare that Powder can light if she gets into trouble, so Vi knows where to find her. Distraught and being left behind because she\'s too weak, Powder takes one of the mana gems and incorporates it into one of her makeshift grenades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Arcane Episode 1 Recap&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jrwTMo9ekezGZUJWeUSrad-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jrwTMo9ekezGZUJWeUSrad-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jrwTMo9ekezGZUJWeUSrad-970-80.jpg 970w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: Riot Games)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Vi, Milo, and Claggor infiltrate Silco\'s fish market and find Vander chained to a chair in a meat locker. Milo begins picking the locks, but the trio soon discover it\'s a trap. Silco\'s goons surround them. Using Vander\'s iron gauntlets, Vi fights to protect the group just as Powder arrives on the scene. Claggor, meanwhile, begins breaking down a ruined wall to create an escape route. After Vi shows what a badass she is by beating the shit out of several thugs, Silco sics a mutated Deckard on her and he quickly defeats her. Seeing this, Powder arms her new mana-gem grenade while an injured Vi crawls back into the meat locker. She slams the door shut just in time to keep Deckard out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Deckard smashes against the door, Claggor finishes clearing their escape route and Milo picks the last of Vander\'s locks. Just then, Powder\'s mana gem grenade&mdash;strapped to a mechanical walking monkey&mdash;wanders right up to Deckard and detonates multiple, violent explosions. Powder is thrown from the rooftop she was hiding on, while Silco and Deckard are caught in the blast. The explosion also ignites Silco\'s Shimmer manufacturing plant, starting an enormous blaze that soon engulfs the entire fish market. In the ensuing explosion, Claggor and Milo are both killed. Marcus, still in the Undercity, sees the explosion from a distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone died from the explosion, however. Vander and Vi are trapped under rubble, and Silco, Deckard, and several goons are still alive. Silco instructs them to kill Vander and Vi while their incapacitated, but Vander summons his last bit of strength, frees himself, and squares off against a mutant Deckard. Vi looks in horror at the corpses of her dead family, Milo and Claggor, but also sees a piece of Powder\'s grenade and realizes she was responsible for the explosion. As Vander continues his desperate battle against Deckard, Silco sneaks up behind him and stabs him. Vander falls from the gangplank they\'re fighting on and lands onto a cache of Shimmer. With his last ounce of life, he drinks one of the vials. Just as Deckard is about to kill Vi, a grotesquely mutated Vander slaughters him. As the flames intensity, Vander chooses to save Vi rather than settle the score with Silco. He smashes through the wall just as the market collapses into flames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Arcane Episode 1 Recap&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/THGGAmSTMp9vLtQ78shxtd-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/THGGAmSTMp9vLtQ78shxtd-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/THGGAmSTMp9vLtQ78shxtd-970-80.jpg 970w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: Riot Games)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Different paths&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Vander dies, his last words to Vi are to take care of her sister. As she mourns his death, Powder shows up. She is so excited that her makeshift grenade actually worked that she doesn\'t realize she murdered all of her friends and adoptive father. &quot;You did this?&quot; Vi says, in disgust, and strikes Powder. &quot;You\'re a Jinx,&quot; Vi says, as her little sister cries. &quot;Milo was right.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unable to cope with the situation, Vi leaves Powder sobbing next to Vander\'s corpse. Just then, Silco arrives with the surviving members of his gang and finds Powder. Vi sees this and tries to save her but Marcus appears from the shadows, knocks her unconscious, and drags her away. But what Vi doesn\'t realize is that Silco doesn\'t want to kill Powder. After Powder explains that Vi seemingly abandoned her, he comforts her like a father. &quot;It\'s OK,&quot; he whispers. &quot;We\'ll show them. We will show them all.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that\'s the end of episode 3, an explosive finale to act 1 that sets the stage for Powder\'s transformation into Jinx.

This is a pressing question, both because of the global disability rights movement, and also because of the current COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s also a very personal question for me. I was born with short stature (achondroplasia). Due to this rare genetic condition, I have had prolonged episodes of back problems, which have come with associated pain and immobility. In 1997, I was bed-bound for six months with sciatica. In 2008, I became paraplegic and spent 10 weeks in a spinal injury unit. Since then, I have used a wheelchair and had constant neuropathic pain. In 2021, I have been bed-bound for months with pain and restriction. I know that many health conditions, irrespective of social context, can be very disabling. In adulthood, I was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which made sense of many aspects of my schooling. While it has not always been an obstacle, and may even have helped me &lsquo;join the dots&rsquo;, I would say it has also limited me as a scholar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Britain and other settings, there has been a public health debate regarding whether disabled people, particularly people with intellectual disabilities, should get priority in receiving the coronavirus vaccine. Most would agree that people at higher risk of getting ill or dying from this disease should jump to the front of this queue. People with Down&rsquo;s syndrome, for example, have a very much higher risk of an adverse outcome from COVID-19. Those with cancer, or some respiratory conditions, or heart disease, or diabetes, also appear to be at greater risk, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some activists have been unhappy at being labelled as &lsquo;vulnerable&rsquo;. This is because they think this terminology reinforces negative ideas about invalidity or inferiority. The clunky phrases &lsquo;clinically vulnerable&rsquo; (CV) or &lsquo;clinically extremely vulnerable&rsquo; (CEV) have been coined to try to avoid this implication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&rsquo;s this fuss really about? Does it say anything about the world we are trying to achieve? Perhaps most importantly, what can disability tell us about being human?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the 1970s, disability rights activists have undermined the equation that physical or mental limitation equals disadvantage. In the first version, limitations were a problem in themselves, but the bigger problem was society. Social factors are unjustly added to the limitation. But increasingly, disabled people have come to regard a health condition as neutral, and attribute to social factors any associated difficulties. In Britain, this has been achieved through the development of what has been labelled the &lsquo;social model of disability&rsquo;. Formalised in 1983 by the sociologist Michael Oliver, this states that people are disabled by society, not by their bodies. In other words, social and environmental barriers cause the problems that arise from different forms of embodiment. These barriers can be removed; failure to remove these barriers constitutes oppression, according to Oliver, or discrimination, to use the language of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, adopted by the United Nations in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, a similar argument has been made, but relying on what has been labelled the &lsquo;minority group model&rsquo; of disability. In the civil rights tradition, this identifies a disadvantaged group &ndash; people with disabilities &ndash; and highlights the remedies that can enable this group to achieve equality. The Americans with Disabilities Act (1990), a pioneering piece of civil rights legislation, dismantles this discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that the social model and the minority group model are not the same, although they merge in much disability rights rhetoric. The first focuses on the ways in which people are disabled: in other words, the social barriers. The second focuses on the group as a whole that is oppressed: in other words, people with disabilities as an identity group. Both models minimise the contribution of impairment and illness to the lives of people who have disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Barnes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198732587.001.0001/acprof-9780198732587&quot;&gt;author&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;i&gt;The Minority Body&lt;/i&gt; (2016), is a metaphysical philosopher who uses a very technical argument to conclude that disability constitutes a &lsquo;Mere Difference&rsquo;, rather than something that makes you worse off. If disabled people have a poorer quality of life, she says this is ultimately because of social factors and social judgments &ndash; a view consistent with the social model I&rsquo;ve outlined. She defines &lsquo;physical disability&rsquo; as what the disability rights movement classify as disabled. She thinks of disability as a cluster of physical factors, but in the end thinks that it is for the group to judge who counts as disabled and who does not, rather than the physical factors themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also says, in a response to criticisms, that &lsquo;a major goal of my book was to argue that we can say &lt;i&gt;both&lt;/i&gt; that some aspects of disability can be difficult, hard and painful in a way that would not be alleviated by social progress, and that disability is not, by itself, bad difference &ndash; and can in many cases be something which enriches and enhances the lives of disabled people.&rsquo; She feels that disabled people can find solidarity in how they cope with their difficult bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good things associated with disability do not balance or outweigh the bad things for me&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have experienced the truth of what Barnes writes. I can see how impairment can shape a person&rsquo;s biography. For example, I cannot conceive of myself as anything other than short-statured or having a hyperactive brain. But I struggle with how she reconciles these views. If disability often involves difficult, hard and painful experiences, I do not understand how it could be a &lsquo;Mere Difference&rsquo;. I suspect that she thinks that other uniquely disability things compensate for what the philosophers Guy Kahane and Julian Savulescu &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/684709&quot;&gt;call&lt;/a&gt; &lsquo;the Detrimental Difference&rsquo;. But I feel that there is an asymmetry. The good things associated with disability do not balance or outweigh the bad things for me. They are not commensurate. I can experience solidarity in many areas of my life, but I would prefer it to come without pain and restriction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disability rights movements in countries such as the UK and the US have often argued that disability is social, not intrinsic, as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://aeon.co/essays/does-using-crip-like-queer-empower-disability-activism&quot;&gt;form&lt;/a&gt; of identity politics. They have followed the pattern of feminist, gay and postcolonial social critics, and said the problem is society, not ourselves. If we reform society, our disadvantage would disappear. This may be true for gender, race and sexuality. But I do not think it is true of much disability. Remember here how different disability is. As well as trivial impairments such as a missing hand or a foot, it also encompasses profound autism and intellectual disability, and crippling depression, and the complications of multiple sclerosis (MS). Some of these are disadvantages in themselves: given the choice, no one would opt to have them. I want to say there is an innate disadvantage that does not go away, especially for the more significant forms of impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, identity politics, as the philosopher Nancy Fraser has said, leads us into dangerous byways. It stresses what divides us from others. It can easily turn into sectarianism. She &lt;a href=&quot;https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii3/articles/nancy-fraser-rethinking-recognition&quot;&gt;argues&lt;/a&gt; that our goal should not be to put this group on a par with another group. Instead, our goal should be to say that this individual is on a par with another individual. We should seek to empower and respect individuals with disabilities, not disability groups &ndash; although the means by which individuals gain such respect may involve group action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people who would rather not be known as vulnerable are not untypical of disabled people in the political sphere. Many people prefer to speak in &lt;a href=&quot;https://aeon.co/essays/what-does-it-mean-to-consider-yourself-a-disabled-person&quot;&gt;terms&lt;/a&gt; of diversity, not disability. This approach puts the onus on society to change and accept. It suggests that there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with having an impairment or illness. These states of being are not intrinsically negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, for many years Deaf people have argued that they are a linguistic minority, not people with impaired hearing. If sign language was widely taught, and interpreters routinely provided, Deaf people would not be excluded. The failure of the UK prime minister&rsquo;s COVID-19 press conferences to offer simultaneous sign language interpretation is symbolic of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with mental health conditions often prefer to speak of themselves as those with &lsquo;psychosocial disability&rsquo;. Following the social model, this language implies that the barriers they face are entirely social, not intrinsic to the condition. Often, the language is of &lsquo;users and survivors of the psychiatric system&rsquo;, which puts the emphasis not on depression or schizophrenia, but on involuntary treatment and confinement in hospitals for the mentally ill. Influenced by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aeon.co/essays/the-psychiatrist-who-didn-t-believe-in-mental-illness&quot;&gt;antipsychiatry&lt;/a&gt; movement, many highlight how no one has ever found a brain difference that explains schizophrenia and depression &ndash; unlike the research demonstrating how Parkinson&rsquo;s disease or MS occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me change the subject for a moment, with a rather sombre question: what do Stive Vermaut, Tim Pauwels, Alessio Galletti, Frederiek Nolf, Rob Goris, Daan Myngheer, Eslam Nasser Zaki and Michael Goolaerts have in common? The sad answer is that they are all professional cyclists who have died from heart attacks in their 20s and 30s since 2004. I am not suggesting a common factor of drug abuse, though some might. Athletes &ndash; whether cyclists or golfers or soccer players or rugby players &ndash; all drive their bodies to the peak of achievement. They are superbly strong and fit. We know they are often injured, and sometimes have career-ending injuries. But we need to acknowledge that these most developed of human bodies are almost always damaged by their success. Everyone knows that boxing is bad for the brain. We are now learning that rugby also damages it with repeated injury and concussion, and there is a move to end heading the ball in soccer. Also, we can see that a golfer will very likely end up with a bad back; the endurance cyclist may do damage to their heart; a footballer may damage their knees. This is not simply bad luck: it is an almost inevitable consequence of pushing a body to the limit of fitness, and making your sport your profession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In daily life, we ordinary folk may have less developed muscles and lower stamina, but we are always prone to coughs and colds, to strains and sprains, to cuts and bruises. As we pass the age of 50, nondisabled people become aware of our body and brain in a new way, as it starts to fail on us. We forget things, we limp, we put on weight, our muscles atrophy, our hair turns grey or falls out, we take longer to heal. Disabled people have those difficulties too but, for many of us, the aches and pains have been with us from the start. It is hard for people with lifelong disability not to be aware of our limitations. It is as if everyone catches up with us, and realises what it is to have back pain, or failing memory. For 20 years, I have been having daily conversations with my best friend about the pain that stops us sleeping: now I have this conversation with other friends too, for whom it is new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The athletics example and the disability example and the example of our everyday lives point to an alternative, and I think preferable, way of thinking about human embodiment. I want to say: to be human is to be embodied, but this is to be weak, vulnerable and mortal. William Shakespeare has Lear say &lsquo;unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor, bare, forked animal as thou art.&rsquo; He also has Hamlet refer to &lsquo;the thousand natural shocks / that flesh is heir to&rsquo;. Contrast this with Ren&eacute; Descartes who, only a generation after Shakespeare, wrote &lsquo;I think, therefore I am&rsquo; and seemed confident that the soul was separable from the machine-like body and would survive it. I believe in this case the poet knew better than the philosopher. While human cognition sets us apart from most other animals, human physicality means we are no different to any other living being. We might better say &lsquo;I hurt, therefore I am&rsquo; or &lsquo;I gradually lose abilities, therefore I am.&rsquo; Of course, philosophy has always engaged with mortality, particularly the existential philosophers such as S&oslash;ren Kierkegaard and Martin Heidegger. But what about the morbidity or the vulnerability that everyone with a body and brain experiences?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To define someone as &lsquo;disabled&rsquo; is to create a dichotomy where in fact we should recognise a continuum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a sometimes hidden strain of pessimistic materialism in Western philosophy that we need to attend to. Thirty years ago, I first encountered the heterodox Italian Marxist philologist Sebastiano Timpanaro, thanks to his collection &lt;i&gt;On Materialism&lt;/i&gt; (1970). His writing alerted me to his forebears such as Lucretius, Friedrich Engels and Giacomo Leopardi. They each ask us to acknowledge that we cannot conquer nature &ndash; whether that be our own physical nature, or the nature that surrounds us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timpanaro was a prophet of environmental politics from the 1960s, warning against both nuclear holocaust but also human-made climate change and the relentless depredations by humans of Earth&rsquo;s natural resources. My friend the historian David Forgacs points out how Timpanaro, after Leopardi, took the biomaterialist and ecomaterialist view that nature was in itself indifferent to humanity and could in fact be either destroyed by humans or could destroy them, unless they found ways of living in harmony with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on this, my own argument for disability rights does not rely on the familiar equation that because disability is to do with social barriers, not bodily deficits, therefore there is a moral and social duty to enable us to participate. Instead, I would argue: to be human is to experience bodily deficits. Everyone has this vulnerability in common. Therefore, make a world that can include everyone, regardless of their differences, as vulnerable to impairment and illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please note, by this I am not saying &lsquo;everyone is disabled&rsquo;. People do not all experience very significant physical or mental limitations, nor the social discrimination associated with them. However, everyone is at risk of illnesses and impairments, and everyone experiences small limitations every day, impairments that tend to increase over time. The world does not divide into &lsquo;disabled people&rsquo; and &lsquo;nondisabled people&rsquo; &ndash; as all social scientists know. There are shades of grey, not black and white. To define someone as &lsquo;disabled&rsquo;, whether for reasons of social policy, statistics or political identity, is to create a dichotomy where in fact we should recognise a continuum. Disability is a contingent property. It is an artefact of the way it is measured, though that is not to say that it isn&rsquo;t real, only to suggest that the line can be drawn in different places, and for different purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it would be culturally, psychologically and philosophically more helpful to recognise our common human vulnerability, and then build a world that included this, acknowledged this, and prevented different exposure to vulnerability leading to social discrimination. The argument I am making here is close to what philosophers such as Eva Feder Kittay are saying, when they criticise John Rawls for failing to include disabled people or those who care for them in his contractarian theory. If, under the &lsquo;veil of ignorance&rsquo;, you imagine that you yourself might be among people who have significant impairments &ndash; or family members of people with these impairments &ndash; then you would be more likely to build a world in which these differences are not ignored but instead minimised by social arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach may also lead us to be less individualist. If we are aware of common vulnerabilities and frailties, then we know we need others to survive. We might require help at any time, or all the time. We might think in terms of interdependence, not independence, much like the feminist ethics of care philosophers such as Joan Tronto, or the African philosophers discussed by Oche Onazi in his recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-35850-1&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;An African Path to Disability Justice&lt;/i&gt; (2019). The Ubuntu philosophy of John Mbiti, for example, says &lsquo;I am because we are; and since we are, therefore I am.&rsquo; Even with barrier removal and better disability equality, disabled people will be much better off in a world in which everyone helps each other and talks to each other. As Kittay has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190622879.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780190622879-e-24&quot;&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt;, some disabled people will not benefit much from disability rights, but will benefit hugely from the support and caring solidarity of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The position I have held for the past 30 years is not popular with some disability rights activists. Yet it is what the vast majority of disabled people know to be true from their personal lives. It is also what emerges from all the qualitative and quantitative evidence about disability that I have seen. We are disabled by society, yes, and by our bodies and brains as well. We often have fewer choices than nondisabled people. On average, we have a narrower margin of health. It can be a real nuisance to be this divergent from the norm. And this does not mean that there might not be some real benefits too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disability justice demands removing social and cultural barriers, but also attending to mental and physical needs and limitations. We can now do so much about both, thanks to medicine, and architecture, and education, technological developments, and antidiscrimination law. But we cannot remove all barriers, and we cannot heal all problems there might be with bodies and minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This being so, there are good reasons to prefer not to have an illness or impairment. This will seem heresy to those who argue that we are simply &lsquo;differently abled&rsquo;. Prevention sometimes makes disabled people anxious. They argue: if I am equally valid as a person, why do we need to stop people becoming like me? Yet, even if we are living good lives ourselves, that does not mean illness or impairment are good, or even neutral. It is not self-hatred or eugenics to avail ourselves of vaccines, prenatal diagnosis, cochlear implants or other treatments. Even those people who themselves already have impairments are usually reluctant to have new impairments, or to have their existing impairments worsen. For example, I did not mind having restricted growth, but I wish I had not ended up in a wheelchair, or spent so many months bed-bound and in pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can try to make the world more inclusive, while also taking folic acid to prevent a child from being born with spina bifida&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The furore over the coronavirus vaccines is relevant. We think that people with learning disabilities should get a higher priority because they have a much bigger risk of dying than others. Why do they have this risk? For some people, it is because they live in congregate living facilities, and the virus spreads very quickly in a care home. For others, it is because they have a compromised immune system or respiratory difficulties, and the virus causes much more serious illness in them, if they contract it. The danger is &lt;i&gt;both&lt;/i&gt; &lsquo;clinically extreme vulnerability&rsquo; &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; social arrangements. &lt;i&gt;Both&lt;/i&gt; biomedical &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; social dimensions contribute to the higher risk of falling ill or even dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can do our best to remedy, or even prevent, illness and impairment, and still want to accept those who, despite these efforts, end up disabled. For example, when I chaired the working group that produced the Nuffield Council on Bioethics&rsquo; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/wp-content/uploads/NIPT-ethical-issues-full-report.pdf&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on non-invasive prenatal testing, I made sure we wrote that we should welcome every child who comes into the world, whether they have a trisomy (an extra chromosome) or not. But this does not mean denying couples the right of screening and, if they want it, selective termination to avoid the birth of an affected child. We can try to make the world more inclusive, while also taking folic acid to prevent a child from being born with spina bifida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every human being has around 100 random mutations in their genome, which might be deleterious. We all carry four or five recessive conditions that could combine with those from a sexual partner to create a foetus with raised risk of a troubling disease. Genetic screening, even embryo selection, cannot remove the vast majority of the disability that life is vulnerable to. But it is a tool we can use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disability will always be with us, even though we can now do much to improve human health and reduce the risks. We are embodied beings, and impairment is the human condition. We have injuries and we develop diseases. If we are fortuitous, we live long lives and develop the impairments associated with ageing, such as macular degeneration and dementia. In the end, we all die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree with Barnes and all those disability academics and activists who want to remove obstacles and build a more inclusive world. One of the positive lessons from the sad tragedy of COVID-19 is that digital communications can be more inclusive. As long as you can get access to a computer or tablet, online platforms can be barrier-free, and can connect people who were previously excluded by physical or communication barriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as we succeed in creating an inclusive world, we need to accept our limitations. Some people will never be able to live or work independently. All of us will grow weary and die. True inclusion is to value people equally, regardless of their abilities. Happiness comes from acceptance of frailties.&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2021-12-15 21:14:57', 786, 1168);
